1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%1%%In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%2%%And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%3%%And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%4%%And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%5%%And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and the evening and the morning were the first day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%6%%And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%7%%And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%8%%And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning were the second day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%9%%And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%10%%And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he called Seas: and God saw that it was good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%11%%And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%12%%And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%13%%And the evening and the morning were the third day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%14%%And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%15%%And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%16%%And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%17%%And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%18%%And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%19%%And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%20%%And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%21%%And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%22%%And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%23%%And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%24%%And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%25%%And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%26%%And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%27%%So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%28%%And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living animal that moveth upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%29%%And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%30%%And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%1%%31%%And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%1%%Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%2%%And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%3%%And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%4%%These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%5%%And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%6%%But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%7%%And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%8%%And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%9%%And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%10%%And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%11%%The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%12%%And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%13%%And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%14%%And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%15%%And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%16%%And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%17%%But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%18%%And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a help meet for him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%19%%And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was its name.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%20%%And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%21%%And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%22%%And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman, and brought her to the man.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%23%%And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%24%%Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%2%%25%%And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%1%%Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%2%%And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%3%%But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%4%%And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%5%%For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%6%%And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise; she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%7%%And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves aprons.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%8%%And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%9%%And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%10%%And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%11%%And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%12%%And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%13%%And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%14%%And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field: upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%15%%And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%16%%To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%17%%And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%18%%Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%19%%In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%20%%And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%21%%For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%22%%And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%23%%Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%3%%24%%So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%1%%And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%2%%And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%3%%And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%4%%And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%5%%But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%6%%And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%7%%If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%8%%And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%9%%And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%10%%And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%11%%And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%12%%When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%13%%And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%14%%Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me will slay me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%15%%And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%16%%And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%17%%And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son Enoch.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%18%%And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%19%%And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%20%%And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%21%%And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%22%%And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%23%%And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%24%%If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%25%%And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%4%%26%%And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%1%%This is the book of the generations of Adam: In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%2%%Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%3%%And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%4%%And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%5%%And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%6%%And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enos:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%7%%And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%8%%And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%9%%And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%10%%And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%11%%And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%12%%And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%13%%And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%14%%And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%15%%And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%16%%And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%17%%And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%18%%And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%19%%And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%20%%And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%21%%And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%22%%And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%23%%And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%24%%And Enoch walked with God, and he was not: for God took him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%25%%And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%26%%And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%27%%And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%28%%And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years; and begat a son:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%29%%And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%30%%And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%31%%And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%5%%32%%And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%1%%And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%2%%That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all whom they chose.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%3%%And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%4%%There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them: the same became mighty men, who were of old, men of renown.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%5%%And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%6%%And the LORD repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%7%%And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping animal, and the fowls of the air; for I repent that I have made them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%8%%But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%9%%These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%10%%And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%11%%The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%12%%And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt: for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%13%%And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%14%%Make thee an ark of gopher-wood: rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%15%%And this is the fashion in which thou shalt make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%16%%A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side: with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%17%%And behold, I, even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven: and every thing that is on the earth shall die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%18%%But with thee will I establish my covenant: and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%19%%And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee: they shall be male and female.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%20%%Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%21%%And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%6%%22%%Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%1%%And the LORD said to Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%2%%Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%3%%Of fowls of the air also by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%4%%For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from the face of the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%5%%And Noah did according to all that the LORD commanded him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%6%%And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%7%%And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%8%%Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every animal that creepeth upon the earth;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%9%%There went in two and two to Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%10%%And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%11%%In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%12%%And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%13%%In the same day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%14%%They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%15%%And they went in to Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, in which is the breath of life.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%16%%And they that entered, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%17%%And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted above the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%18%%And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth: and the ark moved upon the face of the waters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%19%%And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%20%%Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail: and the mountains were covered.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%21%%And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%22%%All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%23%%And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping animals, and the fowl of heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth; and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%7%%24%%And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%1%%And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%2%%The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%3%%And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%4%%And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%5%%And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%6%%And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%7%%And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%8%%Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%9%%But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%10%%And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%11%%And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%12%%And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%13%%And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%14%%And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%15%%And God spoke to Noah, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%16%%Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%17%%Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%18%%And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%19%%Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%20%%And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%21%%And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%8%%22%%While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%1%%And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%2%%And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%3%%Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%4%%But flesh with the life of it, which is its blood, shall ye not eat.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%5%%And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%6%%Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%7%%And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%8%%And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%9%%And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%10%%And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%11%%And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%12%%And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%13%%I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%14%%And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%15%%And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%16%%And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%17%%And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%18%%And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham was the father of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%19%%These three were the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth overspread.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%20%%And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%21%%And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within his tent.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%22%%And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%23%%And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%24%%And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%25%%And he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%26%%And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%27%%God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%28%%And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%9%%29%%And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%1%%Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%2%%The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%3%%And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%4%%And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%5%%By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%6%%And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%7%%And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha; and the sons of Raamah, Sheba, and Dedan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%8%%And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%9%%He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%10%%And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%11%%Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%12%%And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%13%%And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%14%%And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%15%%And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%16%%And the Jebusite, and the Emorite, and the Girgasite,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%17%%And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%18%%And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites dispersed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%19%%And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, to Gaza; as thou goest to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even to Lashah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%20%%These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%21%%To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%22%%The children of Shem; Elam, and Ashur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%23%%And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%24%%And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%25%%And to Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%26%%And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%27%%And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%28%%And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%29%%And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%30%%And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest to Sephar, a mount of the east.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%31%%These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%10%%32%%These are the families of the sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%1%%And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%2%%And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%3%%And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%4%%And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%5%%And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men were building.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%6%%And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%7%%Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%8%%So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%9%%Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%10%%These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%11%%And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%12%%And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%13%%And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%14%%And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%15%%And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%16%%And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%17%%And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%18%%And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%19%%And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%20%%And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%21%%And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%22%%And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%23%%And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%24%%And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%25%%And Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%26%%And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%27%%Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begat Lot.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%28%%And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%29%%And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%30%%But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%31%%And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelt there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%11%%32%%And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%1%%Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, to a land that I will show thee:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%2%%And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%3%%And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%4%%So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%5%%And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%6%%And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%7%%And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%8%%And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%9%%And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%10%%And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%11%%And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%12%%Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%13%%Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%14%%And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%15%%The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%16%%And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%17%%And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%18%%And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%19%%Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%12%%20%%And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%1%%And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%2%%And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%3%%And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%4%%To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%5%%And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%6%%And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%7%%And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%8%%And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%9%%Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou wilt depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%10%%And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest to Zoar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%11%%Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%12%%Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%13%%But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the LORD, exceedingly.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%14%%And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%15%%For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%16%%And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%17%%Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%13%%18%%Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%1%%And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%2%%That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%3%%All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%4%%Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%5%%And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%6%%And the Horites in their mount Seir, to El-paran, which is by the wilderness.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%7%%And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%8%%And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%9%%With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%10%%And the vale of Siddim was full of slime-pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there: and they that remained fled to the mountain.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%11%%And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%12%%And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%13%%And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%14%%And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%15%%And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and smote them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%16%%And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%17%%And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%18%%And Melchisedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%19%%And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%20%%And blessed be the most high God, who hath delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%21%%And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%22%%And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%23%%That I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%14%%24%%Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%1%%After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%2%%And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%3%%And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is my heir.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%4%%And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%5%%And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%6%%And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%7%%And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%8%%And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%9%%And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%10%%And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%11%%And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%12%%And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%13%%And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%14%%And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%15%%And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%16%%But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%17%%And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%18%%In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%19%%The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%20%%And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%15%%21%%And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%1%%Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%2%%And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%3%%And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%4%%And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%5%%And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%6%%But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%7%%And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%8%%And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%9%%And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%10%%And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%11%%And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%12%%And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%13%%And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%14%%Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%15%%And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%16%%16%%And Abram was eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%1%%And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%2%%And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%3%%And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%4%%As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%5%%Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%6%%And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee; and kings shall proceed from thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%7%%And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%8%%And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%9%%And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee, in their generations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%10%%This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%11%%And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%12%%And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%13%%He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%14%%And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%15%%And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%16%%And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall proceed from her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%17%%Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%18%%And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%19%%And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%20%%And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%21%%But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this set time in the next year.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%22%%And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%23%%And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in the same day, as God had said to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%24%%And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%25%%And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%26%%In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%17%%27%%And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%1%%And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%2%%And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%3%%And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%4%%Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%5%%And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%6%%And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%7%%And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%8%%And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%9%%And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%10%%And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%11%%Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%12%%Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%13%%And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%14%%Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%15%%Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%16%%And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%17%%And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%18%%Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%19%%For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%20%%And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%21%%I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%22%%And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%23%%And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%24%%Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%25%%That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%26%%And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%27%%And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%28%%Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%29%%And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%30%%And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%31%%And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%32%%And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%18%%33%%And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%1%%And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom; and Lot seeing them, rose to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%2%%And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%3%%And he urged them greatly; and they turned in to him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%4%%But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%5%%And they called to Lot, and said to him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? bring them out to us, that we may know them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%6%%And Lot went out at the door to them, and shut the door after him,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%7%%And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%8%%Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out to you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only to these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%9%%And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one man came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they pressed hard upon the man, Lot, and came near to break the door.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%10%%But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut the door.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%11%%And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%12%%And the men said to Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%13%%For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them has become great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%14%%And Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Arise, depart from this place; for the LORD will destroy this city: but he seemed to his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%15%%And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%16%%And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters: the LORD being merciful to him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%17%%And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life: look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain: escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%18%%And Lot said to them, Oh, not so, my Lord!
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%19%%Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown to me in saving my life: and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil should take me, and I die:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%20%%Behold now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a small one: Oh, let me escape thither! (Is it not a small one?) and my soul shall live.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%21%%And he said to him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for which thou hast spoken.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%22%%Haste thee, escape thither: for I cannot do any thing till thou hast come thither: therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%23%%The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%24%%Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%25%%And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%26%%But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%27%%And Abraham rose early in the morning, to the place were he stood before the LORD:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%28%%And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards all the land of the plain, and beheld, and lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%29%%And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%30%%And Lot went up from Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he, and his two daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%31%%And the first-born said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%32%%Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%33%%And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%34%%And it came to pass on the morrow that the first born said to the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%35%%And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%36%%Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%37%%And the first-born bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites to this day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%19%%38%%And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%1%%And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%2%%And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%3%%But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she is a man's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%4%%But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%5%%Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%6%%And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%7%%Now therefore restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%8%%Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%9%%Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%10%%And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%11%%And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%12%%And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%13%%And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%14%%And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%15%%And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%16%%And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%17%%So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%20%%18%%For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%1%%And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had spoken.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%2%%For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%3%%And Abraham called the name of his son that was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%4%%And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%5%%And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%6%%And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%7%%And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah shall nurse children? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%8%%And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%9%%And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne to Abraham, mocking.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%10%%Wherefore, she said to Abraham, Cast out this bond-woman, and her son: for the son of this bond-woman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%11%%And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%12%%And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond-woman; in all that Sarah hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%13%%And also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%14%%And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar (putting it on her shoulder) and the child, and sent her away; and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%15%%And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%16%%And she went, and sat her down over against him, a good way off, as it were a bow-shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and raised her voice, and wept.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%17%%And God heard the voice of the lad: and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%18%%Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand: for I will make him a great nation.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%19%%And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%20%%And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%21%%And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took for him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%22%%And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%23%%Now therefore swear to me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%24%%And Abraham said, I will swear.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%25%%And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%26%%And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet have I heard of it, but to-day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%27%%And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a covenant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%28%%And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%29%%And Abimelech said to Abraham, What mean these seven ewe-lambs, which thou hast set by themselves?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%30%%And he said, For these seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take from my hand, that they may be a witness to me, that I have digged this well.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%31%%Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba: because there they swore both of them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%32%%Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: Then Abimelech arose, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%33%%And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%21%%34%%And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%1%%And it came to pass after these things, that God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%2%%And he said, Take now thy son, thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will name to thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%3%%And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and cleft the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose and went to the place which God had named to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%4%%Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%5%%And Abraham said to his young men, Abide you here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and return to you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%6%%And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife: and they went both of them together.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%7%%And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%8%%And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt-offering: so they went both of them together.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%9%%And they came to the place which God had named to him; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order; and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%10%%And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%11%%And the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%12%%And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing to him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld from me thy son, thy only son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%13%%And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%14%%And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it will be seen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%15%%And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven the second time,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%16%%And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%17%%That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%18%%And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%19%%So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%20%%And it came to pass after these things, that it was told to Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also borne children to thy brother Nahor;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%21%%Huz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%22%%And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%23%%And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah bore to Nahor Abraham's brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%22%%24%%And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%1%%And Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%2%%And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%3%%And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%4%%I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%5%%And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%6%%Hear us, my lord; thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead: none of us will withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%7%%And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%8%%And he communed with them, saying, If it is your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%9%%That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me, for a possession of a burying-place among you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%10%%And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, of all that entered the gates of his city, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%11%%Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I to thee, and the cave that is in it, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee: bury thy dead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%12%%And Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%13%%And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field: take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%14%%And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%15%%My lord, hearken to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%16%%And Abraham hearkened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%17%%And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%18%%To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that entered the gate of his city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%19%%And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%23%%20%%And the field, and the cave that is in it were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place, by the sons of Heth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%1%%And Abraham was old and far advanced in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%2%%And Abraham said to his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%3%%And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%4%%But thou shalt go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%5%%And the servant said to him, It may be the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring thy son again to the land from whence thou camest?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%6%%And Abraham said to him, Beware that thou bring not my son thither again.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%7%%The LORD God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To thy seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%8%%And if the woman shall not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only bring not my son thither again.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%9%%And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%10%%And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed; (for all the goods of his master were in his hands:) and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%11%%And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water, at the time of the evening, the time when women go out to draw water:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%12%%And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, prosper me this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%13%%Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%14%%And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and by that shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%15%%And it came to pass before he had done speaking, that behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%16%%And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%17%%And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water from thy pitcher.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%18%%And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%19%%And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, till they have done drinking.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%20%%And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%21%%And the man, wondering at her, held his peace, to know whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous, or not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%22%%And it came to pass as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%23%%And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%24%%And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%25%%She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%26%%And the man bowed his head, and worshipped the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%27%%And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left my master destitute of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%28%%And the damsel ran, and told these things to her mother's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%29%%And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%30%%And it came to pass when he saw the ear-ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%31%%And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; why standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%32%%And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%33%%And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%34%%And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%35%%And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly, and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels, and asses.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%36%%And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him hath he given all that he hath.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%37%%And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%38%%But thou shalt go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%39%%And I said to my master, It may be the woman will not follow me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%40%%And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%41%%Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%42%%And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou dost prosper my way which I go:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%43%%Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%44%%And she saith to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath pointed out for my master's son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%45%%And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%46%%And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%47%%And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the ear-ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%48%%And I bowed my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%49%%And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%50%%Then Laban and Bethuel answered, and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%51%%Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%52%%And it came to pass, that when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%53%%And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%54%%And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%55%%And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%56%%And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%57%%And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%58%%And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%59%%And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%60%%And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%61%%And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%62%%And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%63%%And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%64%%And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%65%%For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail and covered herself.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%66%%And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%24%%67%%And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%1%%Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%2%%And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%3%%And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%4%%And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%5%%And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%6%%But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%7%%And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%8%%Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%9%%And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%10%%The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%11%%And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%12%%Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%13%%And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%14%%And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%15%%Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%16%%These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%17%%And these are the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%18%%And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%19%%And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%20%%And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%21%%And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%22%%And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If it is so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%23%%And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%24%%And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%25%%And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%26%%And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%27%%And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%28%%And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%29%%And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%30%%And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%31%%And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%32%%And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%33%%And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%25%%34%%Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised his birth-right.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%1%%And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%2%%And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%3%%Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%4%%And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%5%%Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%6%%And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%7%%And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%8%%And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%9%%And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%10%%And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%11%%And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%12%%Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%13%%And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%14%%For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%15%%For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%16%%And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%17%%And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%18%%And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%19%%And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%20%%And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%21%%And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%22%%And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%23%%And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%24%%And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%25%%And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%26%%Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%27%%And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%28%%And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%29%%That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%30%%And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%31%%And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%32%%And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%33%%And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%34%%And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%26%%35%%Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%1%%And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%2%%And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%3%%Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%4%%And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%5%%And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%6%%And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%7%%Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%8%%Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%9%%Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%10%%And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%11%%And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%12%%My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%13%%And his mother said to him, upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%14%%And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%15%%And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%16%%And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%17%%And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%18%%And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%19%%And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%20%%And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%21%%And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou art my very son Esau, or not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%22%%And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%23%%And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: So he blessed him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%24%%And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%25%%And he said, bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%26%%And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%27%%And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%28%%Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%29%%Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%30%%And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%31%%And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%32%%And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born Esau.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%33%%And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%34%%And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%35%%And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%36%%And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%37%%And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%38%%And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%39%%And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%40%%And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%41%%And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%42%%And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%43%%Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%44%%And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury shall turn away;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%45%%Till thy brother's anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%27%%46%%And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%1%%And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%2%%Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%3%%And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%4%%And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave to Abraham.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%5%%And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%6%%When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%7%%And that Jacob obeyed his father, and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%8%%And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%9%%Then went Esau to Ishmael, and took to the wives which he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%10%%And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went towards Haran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%11%%And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%12%%And he dreamed, and behold, a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%13%%And behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land on which thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%14%%And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%15%%And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land: for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have declared to thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%16%%And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%17%%And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is no other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%18%%And Jacob rose early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%19%%And he called the name of that place Beth-el: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%20%%And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%21%%So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%28%%22%%And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth to thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%1%%Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%2%%And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%3%%And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%4%%And Jacob said to them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, We are from Haran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%5%%And he said to them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? and they said, We know him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%6%%And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%7%%And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be collected: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%8%%And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks are collected, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%9%%And while he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%10%%And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother; that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%11%%And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%12%%And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%13%%And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%14%%And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh: and he abode with him the space of a month.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%15%%And Laban said to Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for naught? tell me, what shall thy wages be?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%16%%And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%17%%Leah was tender-eyed, but Rachel was beautiful and well-favored.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%18%%And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%19%%And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%20%%And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%21%%And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife (for my days are fulfilled) that I may go in to her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%22%%And Laban assembled all the men of the place, and made a feast.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%23%%And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%24%%And Laban gave to his daughter Leah, Zilpah his maid for a handmaid.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%25%%And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done to me? did I not serve with thee for Rachel? why then hast thou deceived me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%26%%And Laban said, it must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%27%%Fulfill her week, and we will give thee this also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%28%%And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel, his daughter, for a wife also.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%29%%And Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%30%%And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%31%%And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he made her fruitful: but Rachel was barren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%32%%And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%33%%And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%34%%And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband adhere to me, because I have borne him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%29%%35%%And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah, and left bearing.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%1%%And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%2%%And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%3%%And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%4%%And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife: and Jacob went in to her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%5%%And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%6%%And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%7%%And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%8%%And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%9%%When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%10%%And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%11%%And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%12%%And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bore Jacob a second son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%13%%And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%14%%And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%15%%And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%16%%And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%17%%And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%18%%And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%19%%And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%20%%And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%21%%And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%22%%And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%23%%And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%24%%And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%25%%And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%26%%Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%27%%And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%28%%And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%29%%And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%30%%For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%31%%And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%32%%I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%33%%So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%34%%And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%35%%And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%36%%And he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%37%%And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%38%%And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%39%%And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%40%%And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban's cattle.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%41%%And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%42%%But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%30%%43%%And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%1%%And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he obtained all this glory.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%2%%And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and behold, it was not towards him as before.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%3%%And the LORD said to Jacob, Return to the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%4%%And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field to his flock,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%5%%And said to them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not towards me as before: but the God of my father hath been with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%6%%And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%7%%And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%8%%If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bore speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-streaked shall be thy hire; then all the cattle bore ring-streaked.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%9%%Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%10%%And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%11%%And the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%12%%And he said, Lift up now thy eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ring-streaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth to thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%13%%I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst to me a vow: now arise, depart from this land, and return to the land of thy kindred.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%14%%And Rachel and Leah answered, and said to him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%15%%Are we not counted by him strangers; for he hath sold us, and hath quite consumed also our money.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%16%%For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then whatever God hath said to thee, do.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%17%%Then Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%18%%And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gained, the cattle of his getting, which he had gained in Padan-aram; to go to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%19%%And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%20%%And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he was about to depart.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%21%%So he fled with all that he had; and he arose, and passed over the river, and set his face towards the mount Gilead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%22%%And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%23%%And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey: and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%24%%And God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream by night, and said to him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%25%%Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban, with his brethren, pitched in the mount of Gilead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%26%%And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%27%%Why didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%28%%And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons, and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%29%%It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%30%%And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou didst earnestly long after thy father's house; yet why hast thou stolen my gods?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%31%%And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, It may be thou wouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%32%%With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee: for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%33%%And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maid-servants' tents; but he found them not. Then he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%34%%Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%35%%And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%36%%And Jacob was wroth, and chid with Laban: and Jacob answered, and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so eagerly pursued after me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%37%%Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household-stuff? set it here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%38%%These twenty years have I been with thee: thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%39%%That which was torn by beasts, I brought not to thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%40%%Thus I was; in the day the drouth consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from my eyes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%41%%Thus have I been twenty years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%42%%Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst now sent me away empty. God hath seen my affliction, and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%43%%And Laban answered, and said to Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children which they have borne?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%44%%Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%45%%And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%46%%And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they ate there upon the heap.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%47%%And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%48%%And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%49%%And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%50%%If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives besides my daughters; no man is with us; See, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%51%%And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%52%%This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%53%%The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%54%%Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they ate bread, and tarried all night in the mount.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%31%%55%%And early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned to his place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%1%%And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%2%%And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%3%%And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%4%%And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there till now:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%5%%And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-servants, and women-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%6%%And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%7%%Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and herds, and camels, into two bands;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%8%%And said, If Esau shall come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left, will escape.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%9%%And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD who saidst to me, Return to thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%10%%I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shown to thy servant: for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%11%%Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he shall come and smite me, and the mother with the children.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%12%%And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%13%%And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau, his brother;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%14%%Two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%15%%Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%16%%And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%17%%And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%18%%Then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Jacob's: it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and behold also he is behind us.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%19%%And so he commanded the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, In this manner shall ye speak to Esau, when ye find him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%20%%And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%21%%So the present went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the company.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%22%%And he arose that night, and took his two wives, and his two women-servants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%23%%And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that which he had.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%24%%And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%25%%And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh: and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%26%%And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh; And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%27%%And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%28%%And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%29%%And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name: And he said, why is it that thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%30%%And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%31%%And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%32%%32%%Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrunk, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrunk.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%1%%And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%2%%And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%3%%And he passed on before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, till he came near to his brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%4%%And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%5%%And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children, and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%6%%Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%7%%And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%8%%And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, these are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%9%%And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast to thyself.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%10%%And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou hast been pleased with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%11%%Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough: and he urged him, and he took it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%12%%And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%13%%And he said to him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me, and if men should over-drive them one day, all the flock will die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%14%%Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on slowly, according as the cattle that go before me, and the children are able to endure; until I come to my lord to Seir.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%15%%And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the people that are with me: And he said, What needeth it? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%16%%So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%17%%And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%18%%And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan-aram; and pitched his tent before the city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%19%%And he bought a part of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%33%%20%%And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%1%%And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%2%%And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%3%%And his soul cleaved to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly to the damsel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%4%%And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel for a wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%5%%And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the field:) and Jacob held his peace till they had come.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%6%%And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to commune with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%7%%And the sons of Jacob came from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%8%%And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her to him for a wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%9%%And make ye marriages with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters to you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%10%%And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%11%%And Shechem said to her father, and to her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say to me, I will give.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%12%%Ask me never so much dower and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say to me: but give me the damsel for a wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%13%%And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, (because he had defiled Dinah their sister,)
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%14%%And they said to them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that would be a reproach to us:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%15%%But in this will we consent to you: If ye will be as we are, that every male of you shall be circumcised;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%16%%Then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%17%%But if ye will not hearken to us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%18%%And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%19%%And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honorable than all the house of his father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%20%%And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%21%%These men are peaceable with us, therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein: for the land, behold, it is large enough for them: let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%22%%Only herein, will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us shall be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%23%%Will not their cattle, and their substance, and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%24%%And to Hamor and to Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city: and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%25%%And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%26%%And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%27%%The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city; because they had defiled their sister.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%28%%They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%29%%And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives they took captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%30%%And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites, and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they will assemble themselves against me, and slay me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%34%%31%%And they said, Should he deal with our sister, as with a harlot?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%1%%And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, who appeared to thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%2%%Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%3%%And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%4%%And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%5%%And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%6%%So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (that is Beth-el) he and all the people that were with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%7%%And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%8%%But Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Beth-el, under an oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%9%%And God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Padan-aram; and blessed him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%10%%And God said to him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and he called his name Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%11%%And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a multitude of nations shall spring from thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%12%%And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%13%%And God went up from him, in the place where he talked with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%14%%And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink-offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%15%%And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Beth-el.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%16%%And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%17%%And it came to pass when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%18%%And it came to pass as her soul was in departing (for she died) that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%19%%And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Beth-lehem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%20%%And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave to this day.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%21%%And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%22%%And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%23%%The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%24%%The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%25%%And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%26%%And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padan-aram.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%27%%And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah (which is Hebron) where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%28%%And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%35%%29%%And Isaac expired and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%1%%Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%2%%Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%3%%And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%4%%And Adah bore to Esau, Eliphaz; and Bashemath bore Reuel;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%5%%And Aholibamah bore Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%6%%And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%7%%For their riches were more than that they might dwell together: and the land wherein they were strangers could not sustain them, because of their cattle.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%8%%Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%9%%And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites, in mount Seir:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%10%%These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%11%%And the sons of Eliphaz were, Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%12%%And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%13%%And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%14%%And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon Esau's wife: and she bore to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%15%%These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%16%%Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes, descendants of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom: these were the sons of Adah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%17%%And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes, descendants of Reuel, in the land of Edom: these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%18%%And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes, descendants of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah Esau's wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%19%%These are the sons of Esau (who is Edom) and these are their dukes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%20%%These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%21%%And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%22%%And the children of Lotan were Hori, and Heman: and Lotan's sister was Timna.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%23%%And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%24%%And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%25%%And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%26%%And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%27%%The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Achan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%28%%The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%29%%These are the dukes, descendants of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%30%%Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes, descendants of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%31%%And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%32%%And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%33%%And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%34%%And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%35%%And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad (who smote Midian in the field of Moab) reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%36%%And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%37%%And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%38%%And Saul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%39%%And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%40%%And these are the names of the dukes, descendants of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%41%%Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%42%%Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%36%%43%%Duke Magdiel, duke Iram; these are the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%1%%And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%2%%These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought to his father their evil report.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%3%%Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%4%%And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%5%%And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%6%%And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%7%%For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves stood around and made obeisance to my sheaf.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%8%%And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%9%%And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more: and behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%10%%And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said to him, what is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%11%%And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%12%%And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%13%%And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%14%%And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him from the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%15%%And a certain man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%16%%And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%17%%And the man said, They have departed hence: for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%18%%And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near to them, they conspired against him to slay him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%19%%And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer is coming.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%20%%Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit; and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%21%%And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him from their hands: and said, Let us not kill him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%22%%And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might deliver him from their hands, to bring him back to his father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%23%%And it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, his coat of many colors that was on him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%24%%And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty; there was no water in it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%25%%And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and balm, and myrrh, going to carry them down to Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%26%%And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%27%%Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh: and his brethren were content.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%28%%Then there passed by Midianites, merchants; and they drew and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%29%%And Reuben returned to the pit; and behold, Joseph was not in the pit: and he rent his clothes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%30%%And he returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not: and I, whither shall I go?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%31%%And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%32%%And they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%33%%And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%34%%And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%35%%And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning: Thus his father wept for him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%37%%36%%And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%1%%And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%2%%And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in to her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%3%%And she conceived, and bore a son; and he called his name Er.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%4%%And she conceived again, and bore a son; and she called his name Onan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%5%%And she yet again conceived, and bore a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%6%%And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, whose name was Tamar.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%7%%And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%8%%And Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%9%%And Onan knew that the seed would not be his: and it came to pass, when he went in to his brother's wife, that he frustrated the purpose, lest he should give seed to his brother.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%10%%And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%11%%Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son shall be grown; (for he said, Lest perhaps he die also as his brethren did:) and Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%12%%And in process of time, the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died: and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%13%%And it was told to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnath, to shear his sheep.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%14%%And she put off from her, her widow's garments, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath: for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him for a wife.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%15%%When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%16%%And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me have access to thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law:) and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayst have access to me?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%17%%And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock: and she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou sendest it?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%18%%And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? and she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thy hand: and he gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%19%%And she arose and went her way and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%20%%And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%21%%Then he asked the men of that place, saying, where is the harlot that was openly by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot in this place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%22%%And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%23%%And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%24%%And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and also, behold she is with child by lewdness: and Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%25%%When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%26%%And Judah acknowledged them, and said She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her again no more.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%27%%And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that behold, twins were in her womb.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%28%%And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand; and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%29%%And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%38%%30%%And afterwards came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zarah.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%1%%And Joseph was brought down to Egypt: and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down thither.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%2%%And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man: and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%3%%And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%4%%And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%5%%And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake: and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house, and in the field.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%6%%And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught he had, save the bread which he ate; and Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%7%%And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph: and she said, Lie with me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%8%%But he refused, and said to his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%9%%There is none greater in his house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%10%%And it came to pass, as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%11%%And it came to pass, about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%12%%And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and went out.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%13%%And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled forth,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%14%%That she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us: he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%15%%And it came to pass, when he heard that I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and went out.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%16%%And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%17%%And she spoke to him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought to us, came in to me to mock me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%18%%And it came to pass, as I raised my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%19%%And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%20%%And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%21%%But the LORD was with Joseph, and showed him mercy, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%22%%And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, was done by him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%39%%23%%The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him: and that which he did the LORD made it to prosper.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%1%%And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%2%%And Pharaoh was wroth with two of his officers, with the chief of the butlers, and with the chief of the bakers.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%3%%And he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%4%%And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued a season in custody.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%5%%And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream; the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%6%%And Joseph came to them in the morning, and looked upon them, and behold, they were sad.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%7%%And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Why look ye so sad to-day?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%8%%And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%9%%And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%10%%And on the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%11%%And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%12%%And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%13%%Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee to thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%14%%But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness to me, I pray thee, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%15%%For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%16%%When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold, I had three white baskets on my head:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%17%%And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bake-meats for Pharaoh; and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%18%%And Joseph answered, and said, This is the interpretation of it: The three baskets are three days:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%19%%Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%20%%And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birth-day, that he made a feast to all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%21%%And he restored the chief butler to his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%22%%But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%40%%23%%Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%1%%And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and behold, he stood by the river.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%2%%And behold, there came up out of the river seven well-favored cows and fat-fleshed; and they fed in a meadow.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%3%%And behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed; and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%4%%And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven well-favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%5%%And he slept and dreamed the second time: and behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%6%%And behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%7%%And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%8%%And it came to pass in the morning, that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%9%%Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%10%%Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in custody in the captain of the guard's house, both me, and the chief baker:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%11%%And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%12%%And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he interpreted.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%13%%And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was: me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%14%%Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came before Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%15%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard it said of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%16%%And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%17%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%18%%And behold, there came out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed, and well-favored; and they fed in a meadow:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%19%%And behold, seven other cows came out after them, poor, and very ill-favored, and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%20%%And the lean and the ill-favored cows ate up the first seven fat cows:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%21%%And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%22%%And I saw in my dream, and behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, full and good:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%23%%And behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%24%%And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could explain it to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%25%%And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; God hath showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%26%%The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%27%%And the seven thin and ill-favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind will be seven years of famine.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%28%%This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he showeth to Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%29%%Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%30%%And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%31%%And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine following: for it will be very grievous.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%32%%And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%33%%Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%34%%Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%35%%And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh; and let them keep food in the cities.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%36%%And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land may not perish through the famine.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%37%%And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%38%%And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man as this is, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%39%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shown thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%40%%Thou shalt be over my house, and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%41%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%42%%And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%43%%And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had: and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%44%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%45%%And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him for a wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On: and Joseph went over all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%46%%And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%47%%And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfulls.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%48%%And he gathered all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field which was around every city, he laid up in the same.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%49%%And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%50%%And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came: which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%51%%And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%52%%And the name of the second called he Ephraim: for God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%53%%And the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%54%%And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%55%%And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%56%%And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%41%%57%%And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn; because the famine was distressing in all lands.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%1%%Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%2%%And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: go down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%3%%And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%4%%But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren: for he said, Lest perhaps mischief shall befall him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%5%%And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%6%%And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%7%%And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly to them; and he said to them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%8%%And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%9%%And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%10%%And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have thy servants come.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%11%%We are all one man's sons; we are true men; thy servants are no spies.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%12%%And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land have ye come.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%13%%And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%14%%And Joseph said to them, That is what I spoke to you, saying, Ye are spies:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%15%%By this ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother shall come hither.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%16%%Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there is any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%17%%And he put them all together into custody three days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%18%%And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%19%%If ye are true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%20%%But bring your youngest brother to me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%21%%And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%22%%And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the young man; and ye would not hear? therefore behold also his blood is required.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%23%%And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spoke to them by an interpreter.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%24%%And he turned himself away from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%25%%Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he to them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%26%%And they loaded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%27%%And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money: for behold, it was in his sack's mouth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%28%%And he said to his brethren, My money is restored; and see it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done to us?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%29%%And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell them, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%30%%The man who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%31%%And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%32%%We are twelve brethren, sons of our father: one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%33%%And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, By this shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and depart:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%34%%And bring your youngest brother to me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: then will I deliver to you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%35%%And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack; and when they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%36%%And Jacob their father said to them, Me have ye bereaved: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%37%%And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%38%%And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief shall befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%42%%39%%And the famine was severe in the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%1%%And it came to pass, when they had consumed the corn which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%2%%And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%3%%If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%4%%But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%5%%And Israel said, Why dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%6%%And they said, The man asked us strictly concerning our state, and our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%7%%And Judah said to Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%8%%I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not to thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%9%%For except we had delayed, surely now we had returned this second time.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%10%%And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%11%%And take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; it may be it was an oversight:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%12%%Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%13%%And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin: If I be bereaved, I am bereaved.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%14%%And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and arose, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%15%%And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready: for these men shall dine with me at noon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%16%%And the man did as Joseph commanded: and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%17%%And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bond-men, and our asses.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%18%%And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%19%%And said, O sir, we came down indeed at the first time to buy food:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%20%%And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%21%%And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%22%%And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%23%%And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%24%%And they made ready the present against Joseph should come at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%25%%And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%26%%And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%27%%And they answered, Thy servant, our father, is in good health, he is yet alive: and they bowed their heads and made obeisance.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%28%%And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to thee, my son.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%29%%And Joseph made haste; for his bowels yearned towards his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%30%%And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%31%%And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%32%%And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birth-right, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men wondered one at another.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%43%%33%%And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%1%%And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%2%%And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%3%%As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%4%%And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%5%%Is not this the cup in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%6%%And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%7%%And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%8%%Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord's house silver or gold?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%9%%With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bond-men.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%10%%And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%11%%Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%12%%And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%13%%Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%14%%And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%15%%And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%16%%And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%17%%And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%18%%Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%19%%My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%20%%And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%21%%And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%22%%And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%23%%And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%24%%And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%25%%And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%26%%And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother shall be with us.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%27%%And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%28%%And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%29%%And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%30%%Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life)
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%31%%It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%32%%For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%33%%Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%44%%34%%For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%1%%Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me: and there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%2%%And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%3%%And Joseph said to his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%4%%And Joseph said to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you: and they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%5%%Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither; for God sent me before you to preserve life.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%6%%For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in which there shall neither be tillage nor harvest.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%7%%And God sent me before you, to preserve for you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%8%%So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%9%%Haste ye, and return to my father, and say to him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; delay not:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%10%%And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%11%%And there will I nourish thee, (for yet there are five years of famine,) lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, should come to poverty.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%12%%And behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh to you.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%13%%And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste, and bring down my father hither.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%14%%And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%15%%Moreover, he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%16%%And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%17%%And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to thy brethren, This do ye; load your beasts, and go, return to the land of Canaan;
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%18%%And take your father, and your households, and come to me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%19%%Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take for yourselves wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%20%%Also regard not your furniture; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%21%%And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%22%%To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%23%%And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread and meat, for his father by the way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%24%%So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that ye contend not by the way.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%25%%And they went up from Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%26%%And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%27%%And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%45%%28%%And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%1%%And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%2%%And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob: and he said, Here am I.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%3%%And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%4%%I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%5%%And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%6%%And they took their cattle, and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%7%%His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%8%%And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%9%%And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%10%%And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%11%%And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%12%%And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zerah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron, and Hamul.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%13%%And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%14%%And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%15%%These are the sons of Leah, which she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%16%%And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggai, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%17%%And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%18%%These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%19%%The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%20%%And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bore to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%21%%And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%22%%These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; all the souls were fourteen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%23%%And the sons of Dan; Hushim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%24%%And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%25%%These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob: all the souls were seven.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%26%%All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were sixty and six.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%27%%And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%28%%And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct his face to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%29%%And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went to meet Israel his father to Goshen; and presented himself to him: and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%30%%And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%31%%And Joseph said to his brethren, and to his father's house, I will go up, and show Pharaoh, and say to him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan are come to me.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%32%%And the men are shepherds, for their employment hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%33%%And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%46%%34%%That ye shall say, The occupation of thy servants hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%1%%Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, have come from the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%2%%And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%3%%And Pharaoh said to his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%4%%They said moreover to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land: for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%5%%And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren have come to thee:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%6%%The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%7%%And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%8%%And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How old art thou?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%9%%And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, nor have they attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%10%%And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%11%%And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%12%%And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread according to their families.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%13%%And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very distressing, so that the land of Egypt, and all the land of Canaan, fainted by reason of the famine.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%14%%And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%15%%And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence: for the money faileth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%16%%And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money hath failed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%17%%And they brought their cattle to Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread, for all their cattle, for that year.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%18%%When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not aught left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%19%%Why shall we die before thy eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%20%%And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%21%%And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%22%%Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them by Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%23%%Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%24%%And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%25%%And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%26%%And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%27%%And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions in it and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%28%%And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred and forty seven years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%29%%And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%30%%But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%47%%31%%And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%1%%And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%2%%And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%3%%And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%4%%And said to me, Behold I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%5%%And now, thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%6%%And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%7%%And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Beth-lehem.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%8%%And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%9%%And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, to me, and I will bless them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%10%%(Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see:) And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%11%%And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and lo, God hath shown me also thy seed.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%12%%And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%13%%And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%14%%And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands by design; for Manasseh was the first-born.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%15%%And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long to this day,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%16%%The angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac: and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%17%%And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he lifted his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%18%%And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%19%%And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%20%%And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%21%%And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%48%%22%%Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%1%%And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Assemble yourselves, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%2%%Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob: and hearken to Israel your father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%3%%Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellence of dignity, and the excellence of power:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%4%%Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it; he went up to my couch.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%5%%Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in, their habitations.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%6%%O my soul, come not thou into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they digged down a wall.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%7%%Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce: and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%8%%Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thy enemies: thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%9%%Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, thou hast gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion: who shall rouse him up?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%10%%The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh shall come: and to him shall be the gathering of the people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%11%%Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%12%%His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%13%%Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%14%%Issachar is a strong ass, couching down between two burdens:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%15%%And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%16%%Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%17%%Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%18%%I have waited for thy salvation O LORD.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%19%%Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%20%%Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%21%%Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%22%%Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%23%%The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%24%%But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob: from thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%25%%Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%26%%The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills; they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%27%%Benjamin shall raven as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%28%%All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it which their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%29%%And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%30%%In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%31%%(There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah,)
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%32%%The purchase of the field and of the cave that is in it, was from the children of Heth.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%49%%33%%And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his people.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%1%%And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%2%%And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%3%%And forty days were fulfilled for him; (for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed:) and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%4%%And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%5%%My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%6%%And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%7%%And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%8%%And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds they left in the land of Goshen.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%9%%And there went with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%10%%And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%11%%And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%12%%And his sons did to him according as he commanded them:
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%13%%For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying-place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%14%%And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%15%%And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will perhaps hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%16%%And they sent messengers to Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before he died, saying,
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%17%%So shall ye say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did to thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%18%%And his brethren also went and fell down before his face: and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%19%%And Joseph said to them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%20%%But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%21%%Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%22%%And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%23%%And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%24%%And Joseph said to his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%25%%And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
1000005%%Genesis%%OT%%50%%26%%So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%1%%Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%2%%Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%3%%Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%4%%Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%5%%And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%6%%And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%7%%And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%8%%Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%9%%And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%10%%Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%11%%Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%12%%But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%13%%And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%14%%And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, was with rigor.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%15%%And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:)
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%16%%And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it shall be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it shall be a daughter, then she shall live.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%17%%But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%18%%And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%19%%And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%20%%Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%21%%And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%1%%22%%And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%1%%And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%2%%And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%3%%And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%4%%And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%5%%And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river's side: and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%6%%And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%7%%Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%8%%And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%9%%And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%10%%And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%11%%And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%12%%And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%13%%And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%14%%And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%15%%Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%16%%Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%17%%And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%18%%And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%19%%And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%20%%And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%21%%And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%22%%And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%23%%And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%24%%And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%2%%25%%And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%1%%Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%2%%And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%3%%And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%4%%And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%5%%And he said, Approach not hither: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest is holy ground.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%6%%Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%7%%And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%8%%And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%9%%Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%10%%Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%11%%And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%12%%And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%13%%And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%14%%And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%15%%And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%16%%Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%17%%And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%18%%And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%19%%And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%20%%And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%21%%And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%3%%22%%But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters: and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%1%%And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%2%%And the LORD said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%3%%And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%4%%And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%5%%That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%6%%And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%7%%And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%8%%And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%9%%And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%10%%And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%11%%And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%12%%Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%13%%And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%14%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%15%%And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%16%%And he shall speak for thee to the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%17%%And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%18%%And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%19%%And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%20%%And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%21%%And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%22%%And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my first-born.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%23%%And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%24%%And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%25%%Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%26%%So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%27%%And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%28%%And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%29%%And Moses and Aaron went, and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%30%%And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%4%%31%%And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%1%%And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%2%%And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%3%%And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%4%%And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%5%%And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%6%%And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%7%%Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%8%%And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%9%%Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%10%%And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%11%%Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%12%%So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%13%%And the task-masters hastened them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%14%%And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%15%%Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%16%%There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thy own people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%17%%But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, and do sacrifice to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%18%%Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%19%%And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks of your daily task.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%20%%And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%21%%And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%22%%And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou so ill treated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%5%%23%%For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%1%%Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%2%%And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%3%%And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%4%%And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%5%%And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%6%%Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%7%%And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%8%%And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%9%%And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%10%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%11%%Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%12%%And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%13%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%14%%These are the heads of their father's houses: The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these are the families of Reuben.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%15%%And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%16%%And these are the names of the sons of Levi, according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty-seven years.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%17%%The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%18%%And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred and thirty-three years.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%19%%And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi, according to their generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%20%%And Amram took him Jochebed, his father's sister, for a wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%21%%And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%22%%And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%23%%And Aaron took him Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, for a wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%24%%And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%25%%And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took him one of the daughters of Putiel for a wife; and she bore to him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%26%%These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%27%%These are they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%28%%And it came to pass, on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%29%%That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%6%%30%%And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%2%%Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%3%%And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%4%%But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%5%%And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%6%%And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%7%%And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%8%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%9%%When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%10%%And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%11%%Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%12%%For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%13%%And he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%14%%And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuseth to let the people go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%15%%Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%16%%And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%17%%Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%18%%And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%19%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood: and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%20%%And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%21%%And the fish that was in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%22%%And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%23%%And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%24%%And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%7%%25%%And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go that they may serve me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%2%%And if thou shalt refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%3%%And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%4%%And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%5%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%6%%And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%7%%And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%8%%Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people: and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%9%%And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%10%%And he said, To-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like the LORD our God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%11%%And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%12%%And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%13%%And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%14%%And they gathered them into heaps: and the land was offensive in smell.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%15%%But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%16%%And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%17%%And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%18%%And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%19%%Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%20%%And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%21%%Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%22%%And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%23%%And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to-morrow shall this sign be.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%24%%And the LORD did so: and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%25%%And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%26%%And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%27%%We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%28%%And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%29%%And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%30%%And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%31%%And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%8%%32%%And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%1%%Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%2%%For if thou shalt refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%3%%Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%4%%And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%5%%And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%6%%And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%7%%And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%8%%And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%9%%And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%10%%And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%11%%And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil: for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%12%%And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%13%%And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%14%%For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%15%%For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%16%%And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, to show in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%17%%As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%18%%Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%19%%Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%20%%He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%21%%And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%22%%And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%23%%And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%24%%So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%25%%And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%26%%Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%27%%And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%28%%Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%29%%And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%30%%But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%31%%And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%32%%But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown up.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%33%%And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%34%%And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%9%%35%%And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants; that I might show these my signs before him:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%2%%And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%3%%And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%4%%Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%5%%And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%6%%And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%7%%And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%8%%And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%9%%And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%10%%And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%11%%Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%12%%And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%13%%And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night: and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%14%%And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%15%%For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%16%%Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%17%%Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%18%%And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%19%%And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%20%%But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%21%%And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%22%%And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%23%%They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%24%%And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%25%%And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%26%%Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%27%%But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%28%%And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more: for in that day thou seest my face, thou shalt die.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%10%%29%%And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%2%%Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%3%%And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%4%%And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%5%%And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%6%%And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%7%%But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%8%%And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will depart: and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%9%%And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%11%%10%%And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%2%%This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%3%%Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%4%%And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%5%%Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%6%%And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%7%%And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%8%%And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%9%%Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%10%%And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning: and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%11%%And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste; it is the LORD'S passover.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%12%%For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%13%%And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%14%%And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%15%%Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%16%%And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you: no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%17%%And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%18%%In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%19%%Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%20%%Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%21%%Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%22%%And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin: and none of you shall go out at the door of his house till the morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%23%%For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%24%%And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%25%%And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%26%%And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%27%%That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%28%%And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%29%%And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%30%%And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%31%%And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, and depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel: and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%32%%Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone: and bless me also.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%33%%And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%34%%And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%35%%And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%36%%And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them such things as they requested: and they spoiled the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%37%%And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%38%%And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%39%%And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened: because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%40%%Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%41%%And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%42%%It is a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%43%%And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%44%%But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%45%%A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%46%%In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house: neither shall ye break a bone of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%47%%All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%48%%And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%49%%One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%50%%Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%12%%51%%And it came to pass the same day, that the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%2%%Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%3%%And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%4%%This day ye came out in the month Abib.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%5%%And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%6%%Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%7%%Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%8%%And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%9%%And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%10%%Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%11%%And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%12%%That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males shall be the LORD'S.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%13%%And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%14%%And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%15%%And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%16%%And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%17%%And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%18%%But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%19%%And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%20%%And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%21%%And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light: to go by day and night.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%13%%22%%He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%3%%For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%4%%And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%5%%And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%6%%And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%7%%And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%8%%And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%9%%But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%10%%And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%11%%And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%12%%Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%13%%And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%14%%The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%15%%And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%16%%But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%17%%And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%18%%And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%19%%And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%20%%And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%21%%And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%22%%And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%23%%And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%24%%And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%25%%And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%26%%And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%27%%And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%28%%And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%29%%But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%30%%Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%14%%31%%And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%1%%Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%2%%The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%3%%The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%4%%Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%5%%The depths have covered them: they sunk to the bottom as a stone.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%6%%Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%7%%And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%8%%And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%9%%The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%10%%Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%11%%Who is like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders!
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%12%%Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%13%%Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%14%%The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%15%%Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%16%%Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%17%%Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; in the sanctuary, O Lord. which thy hands have established.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%18%%The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%19%%For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%20%%And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%21%%And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%22%%So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%23%%And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%24%%And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%25%%And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%26%%And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%15%%27%%And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%1%%And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%2%%And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%3%%And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%4%%Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%5%%And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%6%%And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%7%%And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: And what are we, that ye murmur against us?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%8%%And Moses said, This shall be when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: And what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%9%%And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%10%%And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%11%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%12%%I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%13%%And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%14%%And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%15%%And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%16%%This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every man according to the number of your persons, take ye every man for them who are in his tents.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%17%%And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%18%%And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered every man according to his eating.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%19%%And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%20%%Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%21%%And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%22%%And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%23%%And he said to them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%24%%And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%25%%And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%26%%Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there will be none.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%27%%And it came to pass, that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%28%%And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%29%%See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%30%%So the people rested on the seventh day.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%31%%And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%32%%And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%33%%And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%34%%As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%35%%And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%16%%36%%Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%1%%And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%2%%Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%3%%And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%4%%And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%5%%And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel: and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%6%%Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%7%%And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%8%%Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%9%%And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%10%%So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%11%%And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%12%%But Moses's hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it: and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%13%%And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%14%%And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%15%%And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%17%%16%%For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%1%%When Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses's father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%2%%Then Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses's wife, after he had sent her back,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%3%%And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:)
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%4%%And the name of the other was Eliezer; (for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:)
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%5%%And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%6%%And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%7%%And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare: and they came into the tent.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%8%%And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%9%%And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%10%%And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%11%%Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, he was above them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%12%%And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses's father-in-law before God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%13%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%14%%And when Moses's father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%15%%And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%16%%When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%17%%And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%18%%Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%19%%Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%20%%And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%21%%Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%22%%And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%23%%If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%24%%So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%25%%And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%26%%And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%18%%27%%And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%1%%In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%2%%For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%3%%And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%4%%Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%5%%Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%6%%And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%7%%And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%8%%And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%9%%And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%10%%And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%11%%And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%12%%And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%13%%There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%14%%And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%15%%And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%16%%And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%17%%And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%18%%And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%19%%And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%20%%And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%21%%And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%22%%And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%23%%And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%24%%And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%19%%25%%So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%1%%And God spoke all these words, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%2%%I am the LORD thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%3%%Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%4%%Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%5%%Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%6%%And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%7%%Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%8%%Remember the sabbath-day to keep it holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%9%%Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%10%%But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%11%%For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath-day, and hallowed it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%12%%Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%13%%Thou shalt not kill.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%14%%Thou shalt not commit adultery.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%15%%Thou shalt not steal.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%16%%Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%17%%Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%18%%And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%19%%And they said to Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%20%%And Moses said to the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%21%%And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%22%%And the LORD said to Moses, Thus thou shalt say to the children of Israel; Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%23%%Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make to you gods of gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%24%%An altar of earth thou shalt make to me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thy oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to thee, and I will bless thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%25%%And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou shalt lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%20%%26%%Neither shalt thou go up by steps to my altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%1%%Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%2%%If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall depart free for nothing.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%3%%If he came in by himself, he shall depart by himself: if he was married, then his wife shall depart with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%4%%If his master hath given him a wife, and she hath borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall depart by himself.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%5%%And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not depart free:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%6%%Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door-post: and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%7%%And if a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not depart as the men-servants do.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%8%%If she shall not please her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%9%%And if he hath betrothed her to his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%10%%If he shall take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%11%%And if he shall not perform these three to her, then shall she depart free without money.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%12%%He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall be surely put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%13%%And if a man shall not lie in wait, but God shall deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%14%%But if a man shall come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%15%%And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%16%%And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he shall be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%17%%And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%18%%And if men contend together, and one shall smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he shall not die, but keep his bed:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%19%%If he shall rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%20%%And if a man shall smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he shall die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%21%%Notwithstanding, if he shall continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his money.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%22%%If men shall contend, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit shall depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%23%%And if any mischief shall follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%24%%Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%25%%Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%26%%And if a man shall smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it shall perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%27%%And if he shall smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%28%%If an ox shall gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%29%%But if the ox was accustomed to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not restrained him, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%30%%If there shall be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%31%%Whether he hath gored a son, or hath gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%32%%If the ox shall push a man-servant, or maid-servant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%33%%And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall into it;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%34%%The owner of the pit shall make compensation, and give money to the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%35%%And if one man's ox shall hurt another's that he shall die, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it, and the dead ox also they shall divide.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%21%%36%%Or if it shall be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not restrained him; he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%1%%If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%2%%If a thief shall be found breaking through, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%3%%If the sun shall have risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him: for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%4%%If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%5%%If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field: of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%6%%If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%7%%If a man shall deliver to his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief shall be found, let him pay double.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%8%%If the thief shall not be found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he hath put his hand to his neighbor's goods.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%9%%For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his: the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and he whom the judges shall condemn, shall pay double to his neighbor.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%10%%If a man shall deliver to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast to keep; and it shall die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%11%%Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept of it, and he shall not make restitution.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%12%%And if it shall be stolen from him, he shall make restitution to the owner of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%13%%If it shall be torn in pieces; then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%14%%And if a man shall borrow aught of his neighbor, and it shall be hurt, or die, the owner of it being not with it, he shall surely make it good.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%15%%But if the owner of it shall be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for his hire.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%16%%And if a man shall entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%17%%If her father shall utterly refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the dower of virgins.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%18%%Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%19%%Whoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%20%%He that sacrificeth to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%21%%Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%22%%Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%23%%If thou shalt afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%24%%And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%25%%If thou shalt lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%26%%If thou shalt at all take thy neighbor's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it to him by the setting of the sun.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%27%%For that is his only covering, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%28%%Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%29%%Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give to me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%30%%Likewise shalt thou do with thy oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%22%%31%%And ye shall be holy men to me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%1%%Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%2%%Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%3%%Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%4%%If thou shalt meet thy enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%5%%If thou shalt see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%6%%Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%7%%Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%8%%And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%9%%Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger; for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%10%%And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%11%%But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave, the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy olive-yard.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%12%%Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thy ox and thy ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%13%%And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the names of other gods, neither let it be heard from thy mouth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%14%%Three times thou shalt keep a feast to me in the year.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%15%%Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%16%%And the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of in-gathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labors out of the field.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%17%%Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%18%%Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%19%%The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%20%%Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%21%%Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%22%%But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy to thy enemies, and an adversary to thy adversaries.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%23%%For my Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%24%%Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%25%%And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%26%%There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: I will complete the number of thy days.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%27%%I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thy enemies turn their backs to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%28%%And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%29%%I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land should become desolate, and the beast of the field should multiply against thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%30%%By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou shalt be increased and inherit the land.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%31%%And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%32%%Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%23%%33%%They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee to sin against me: for if thou shalt serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%1%%And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%2%%And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%3%%And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we perform.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%4%%And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%5%%And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%6%%And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%7%%And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%8%%And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold, the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%9%%Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%10%%And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire-stone, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%11%%And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and ate and drank.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%12%%And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me on the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayst teach them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%13%%And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up upon the mount of God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%14%%And he said to the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again to you: and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man hath any matters to do, let him come to them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%15%%And Moses went up upon the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%16%%And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%17%%And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount, in the eyes of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%24%%18%%And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mount: and Moses was on the mount forty days and forty nights.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%25%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%25%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%25%%3%%And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver and brass,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%25%%4%%And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair.

1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%32%%And there shall be a hole in the top of it, in the midst of it: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%33%%And beneath, upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about its hem; and bells of gold between them around it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%34%%A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe around it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%35%%And it shall be upon Aaron, to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in to the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out; that he may not die.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%36%%And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and engrave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%37%%And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the miter; upon the front of the miter it shall be.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%38%%And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%39%%And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the miter of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of needle-work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%40%%And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%41%%And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and on his sons with him: and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%42%%And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness: from the loins even to the thighs they shall reach:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%28%%43%%And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they enter in to the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near to the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die. It shall be a statute for ever to him, and to his seed after him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%1%%And this is the thing that thou shalt do to them to hallow them, to minister to me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%2%%And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil; of wheat flour shalt thou make them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%3%%And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%4%%And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%5%%And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron, the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breast-plate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%6%%And thou shalt put the miter upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the miter.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%7%%Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%8%%And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%9%%And thou shalt gird them with girdles (Aaron and his sons) and put the bonnets on them; and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%10%%And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%11%%And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%12%%And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%13%%And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%14%%But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin-offering.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%15%%Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%16%%And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it around upon the altar.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%17%%And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them to his pieces, and to his head.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%18%%And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering to the LORD: it is a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%19%%And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%20%%Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%21%%And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%22%%Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%23%%And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread, that is before the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%24%%And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%25%%And thou shalt receive them from their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%26%%And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%27%%And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave-offering, and the shoulder of the heave-offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%28%%And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever, from the children of Israel: for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%29%%And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%30%%And that son, that is priest in his stead, shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%31%%And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%32%%And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%33%%And they shall eat those things with which the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat of them, because they are holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%34%%And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, shall remain till the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%35%%And thus shalt thou do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%36%%And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin-offering for atonement; and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%37%%Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%38%%Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year, day by day continually.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%39%%The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%40%%And with the one lamb a tenth-portion of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%41%%And the other lamb thou shalt offer at evening, and shalt do thereto according to the meat-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%42%%This shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you to speak there to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%43%%And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%44%%And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%45%%And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%29%%46%%And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%1%%And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%2%%A cubit shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be its hight: its horns shall be of the same.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%3%%And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%4%%And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by its two corners, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staffs to bear it with.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%5%%And thou shalt make the staffs of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%6%%And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%7%%And Aaron shall burn upon it sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%8%%And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at evening, he shall burn incense upon it; a perpetual incense before the LORD, throughout your generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%9%%Ye shall offer no strange incense upon it, nor burnt-sacrifice, nor meat-offering; neither shall ye pour drink-offering upon it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%10%%And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year, with the blood of the sin-offering of atonements: once in a year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%11%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%12%%When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when thou numberest them: that there may be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%13%%This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) a half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%14%%Every one that passeth among them that are numbered from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%15%%The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering to the LORD to make an atonement for your souls.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%16%%And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial to the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%17%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%18%%Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and its foot also of brass, to wash in: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%19%%For Aaron and their sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%20%%When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not: or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%21%%So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%22%%Moreover the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%23%%Take thou also to thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%24%%And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive-oil a hin:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%25%%And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%26%%And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation with it, and the ark of the testimony,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%27%%And the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of incense,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%28%%And the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its foot.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%29%%And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatever toucheth them shall be holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%30%%And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%31%%And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil to me, throughout your generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%32%%Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy to you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%33%%Whoever compoundeth any like it, or whoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%34%%And the LORD said to Moses, Take to thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%35%%And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%36%%And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be to you most holy:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%37%%And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to its composition: it shall be to thee holy for the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%30%%38%%Whoever shall make the like to that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%2%%See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%3%%And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%4%%To devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%5%%And in cutting of stones to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%6%%And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom; that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%7%%The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is upon it, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%8%%And the table and its furniture, and the pure candlestick with all its furniture, and the altar of incense,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%9%%And the altar of burnt-offering, with all its furniture, and the laver and its foot,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%10%%And the clothes of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%11%%And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee, shall they do.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%12%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%13%%Speak thou also to the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%14%%Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore: for it is holy to you. Every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death: for whoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%15%%Six days may work be done, but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever doeth any work in the sabbath-day, he shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%16%%Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%17%%It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%31%%18%%And to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, he gave two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%1%%And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people assembled themselves to Aaron, and said to him, Arise, make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%2%%And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden ear-rings which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%3%%And all the people broke off the golden ear-rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%4%%And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%5%%And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow is a feast to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%6%%And they rose early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings: and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%7%%And the LORD said to Moses, Go, go down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%8%%They have turned aside quickly from the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%9%%And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and behold it is a stiff-necked people:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%10%%Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%11%%And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why [] thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast [] forth from the land of Egypt, with great power, and with [] mighty hand?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%12%%Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%13%%Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thine own self, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%14%%And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%15%%And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%16%%And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%17%%And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%18%%And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%19%%And it came to pass as soon as he came nigh to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses's anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables from his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%20%%And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%21%%And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%22%%And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%23%%For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%24%%And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break it off: So they gave it to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%25%%And when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame, among their enemies:)
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%26%%Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%27%%And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%28%%And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%29%%For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%30%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%31%%And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%32%%Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%33%%And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%34%%Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to thee: Behold, my angel shall go before thee: Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%32%%35%%And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, Depart and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%2%%And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%3%%To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%4%%And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%5%%For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%6%%And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%7%%And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%8%%And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%9%%And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%10%%And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose and worshiped, every man in his tent-door.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%11%%And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%12%%And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%13%%Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%14%%And he said, My presence shall attend thee, and I will give thee rest.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%15%%And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%16%%For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%17%%And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%18%%And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%19%%And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%20%%And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%21%%And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%22%%And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock: and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%33%%23%%And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%2%%And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%3%%And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%4%%And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%5%%And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%6%%And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%7%%Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%8%%And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%9%%And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it is a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%10%%And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art, shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%11%%Observe thou that which I command thee this day: Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%12%%Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%13%%But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%14%%For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%15%%Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%16%%And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%17%%Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%18%%The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%19%%Every first-born is mine: and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%20%%But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%21%%Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%22%%And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year's end.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%23%%Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%24%%For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%25%%Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%26%%The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%27%%And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%28%%And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water: and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%29%%And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%30%%And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%31%%And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%32%%And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%33%%And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%34%%But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%34%%35%%And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%1%%And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%2%%Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever doth work therein shall be put to death.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%3%%Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath-day.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%4%%And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%5%%Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%6%%And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%7%%And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%8%%And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%9%%And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breast-plate.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%10%%And every wise-hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%11%%The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its buttons, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%12%%The ark, and its staffs, with the mercy-seat, and the vail of the covering,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%13%%The table, and its staffs, and all its vessels, and the show-bread,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%14%%The candlestick also for the light, and its furniture, and its lamps, with the oil for the light,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%15%%And the incense-altar, and its staffs, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%16%%The altar of burnt-offering, with its brazen grate, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%17%%The hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%18%%The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%19%%The clothes of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%20%%And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%21%%And they came, every one whose heart excited him, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%22%%And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, offered an offering of gold to the LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%23%%And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%24%%Every one that offered an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD'S offering: and every man with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%25%%And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%26%%And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats' hair.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%27%%And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breast-plate;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%28%%And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%29%%The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%30%%And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%31%%And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%32%%And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%33%%And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of curious work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%34%%And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%35%%35%%Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise curious work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%1%%Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%2%%And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart excited him to come to the work to do it:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%3%%And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%4%%And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%5%%And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%6%%And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%7%%For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%8%%And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: he made them with cherubim of curious work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%9%%The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%10%%And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%11%%And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the extremity of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%12%%Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%13%%And he made fifty buttons of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the buttons. So it became one tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%14%%And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%15%%The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%16%%And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%17%%And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%18%%And he made fifty buttons of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%19%%And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%20%%And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%21%%The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%22%%One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%23%%And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%24%%And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%25%%And for the other side of the tabernacle which is towards the north corner, he made twenty boards.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%26%%And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%27%%And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%28%%And two boards he made for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%29%%And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%30%%And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%31%%And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%32%%And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%33%%And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%34%%And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%35%%And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim he made it of curious work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%36%%And he made to it four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%37%%And he made a hanging for the tabernacle-door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needle-work;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%36%%38%%And the five pillars of it, with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%1%%And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the hight of it:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%2%%And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%3%%And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%4%%And he made staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%5%%And he put the staffs into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%6%%And he made the mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and one cubit and a half the breadth of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%7%%And he made two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the mercy-seat;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%8%%One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy-seat made he the cherubim on the two ends of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%9%%And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy-seat, with their faces one to another; even towards the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%10%%And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its hight:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%11%%And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made to it a crown of gold round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%12%%Also he made to it a border of a hand-breadth round about; and made a crown of gold for its border round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%13%%And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in its four feet.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%14%%Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staffs, to bear the table.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%15%%And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%16%%And he made the vessels which were upon the table, its dishes, and its spoons, and its bowls, and its covers to cover with, of pure gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%17%%And he made the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he made the candlestick; its shaft, and its branch, its bowls, its knobs, and its flowers were of the same:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%18%%And six branches proceeding from its sides; three branches of the candlestick from the one side of it, and three branches of the candlestick from the other side of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%19%%Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knob and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knob and a flower: so throughout the six branches proceeding from the candlestick.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%20%%And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, its knobs, and its flowers:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%21%%And a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, and a knob under two branches of the same, according to the six branches proceeding from it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%22%%Their knobs and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%23%%And he made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%24%%Of a talent of pure gold he made it, and all its vessels.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%25%%And he made the incense-altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the hight of it; the horns of it were of the same.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%26%%And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and its sides round about, and its horns: also he made to it a crown of gold round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%27%%And he made two rings of gold for it under its crown, by the two corners of it, upon its two sides, to be places for the staffs to bear it with.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%28%%And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%37%%29%%And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%1%%And he made the altar of burnt-offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length of it, and five cubits the breadth of it; it was foursquare; and its hight was three cubits.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%2%%And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%3%%And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basins, and the flesh-hooks, and the fire-pans: all the vessels of it he made of brass.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%4%%And he made for the altar a brazen grate of net-work under the compass of it beneath to the midst of it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%5%%And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staffs.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%6%%And he made the staffs of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%7%%And he put the staffs into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with; he made the altar hollow with boards.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%8%%And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the looking-glasses of the women assembling, who assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%9%%And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, a hundred cubits:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%10%%Their pillars were twenty, and their brazen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, were of silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%11%%And for the north side, the hangings were a hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty: the hooks of the pillars, and their filets, of silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%12%%And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%13%%And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%14%%The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%15%%And for the other side of the court-gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%16%%All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%17%%And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver; and the overlaying of their capitals of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%18%%And the hanging for the gate of the court was needle-work, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the hight in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%19%%And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals and their fillets of silver.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%20%%And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%21%%This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%22%%And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%23%%And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%24%%All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%25%%And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was a hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and seventy five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%26%%A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%27%%And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; a hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%28%%And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and filleted them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%29%%And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%30%%And with this he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%38%%31%%And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%1%%And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made clothes of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%2%%And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%3%%And they beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with curious work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%4%%They made shoulder-pieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%5%%And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%6%%And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%7%%And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%8%%And he made the breast-plate of curious work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%9%%It was foursquare; they made the breast-plate double: a span was the length of it, and a span the breadth of it, being doubled.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%10%%And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%11%%And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%12%%And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%13%%And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%14%%And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%15%%And they made upon the breast-plate chains at the ends, of wreathed work of pure gold.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%16%%And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast-plate.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%17%%And they put the two wreathed chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast-plate.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%18%%And the two ends of the two wreathed chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, before it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%19%%And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breast-plate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%20%%And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, towards the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%21%%And they bound the breast-plate by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breast-plate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%22%%And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%23%%And there was a hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band around the hole, that it should not rend.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%24%%And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%25%%And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, around between the pomegranates;
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%26%%A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%27%%And they made coats of fine linen, of woven work, for Aaron and for his sons,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%28%%And a miter of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%29%%And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needle-work; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%30%%And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%31%%And they tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the miter; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%32%%Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%33%%And they brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent, and all its furniture, its buttons, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%34%%And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%35%%The ark of the testimony, and its staffs, and the mercy-seat,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%36%%The table, and all its vessels, and the show-bread,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%37%%The pure candlestick, with its lamps, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all its vessels, and the oil for light,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%38%%And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle-door,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%39%%The brazen altar, and its grate of brass, its staffs, and all its vessels, the laver and its foot,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%40%%The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the hanging for the court-gate, its cords, and its pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%41%%The clothes of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%42%%According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%39%%43%%And Moses looked upon all the work, and behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%2%%On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%3%%And thou shalt put in it the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%4%%And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light its lamps.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%5%%And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%6%%And thou shalt set the altar of the, burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%7%%And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water in it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%8%%And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court-gate.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%9%%And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its vessels: and it shall be holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%10%%And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt-offering and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%11%%And thou shalt anoint the laver and its foot, and sanctify it.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%12%%And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%13%%And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister to me in the priest's office.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%14%%And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%15%%And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister to me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%16%%Thus did Moses; according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%17%%And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%18%%And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened its sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars, and reared up its pillars.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%19%%And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%20%%And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staffs on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%21%%And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%22%%And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%23%%And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%24%%And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%25%%And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%26%%And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%27%%And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%28%%And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%29%%And he put the altar of burnt-offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%30%%And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%31%%And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%32%%When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%33%%And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate: so Moses finished the work.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%34%%Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%35%%And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%36%%And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%37%%But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
1000005%%Exodus%%OT%%40%%38%%For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%1%%And the LORD called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man of you shall bring an offering to the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%3%%If his offering shall be a burnt-sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%4%%And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%5%%And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%6%%And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%7%%And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%8%%And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%9%%But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt-sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%10%%And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%11%%And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood around upon the altar:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%12%%And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%13%%But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%14%%And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD shall be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtle doves, or of young pigeons.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%15%%And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar: and its blood shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%16%%And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%1%%17%%And he shall cleave it with its wings, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%1%%And when any will offer a meat-offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense upon it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%2%%And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take out of it his handful of its flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%3%%And the remnant of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%4%%And if thou shalt bring an oblation of a meat-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%5%%And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%6%%Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil upon it: it is a meat-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%7%%And if thy oblation shall be a meat-offering baked in the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%8%%And thou shalt bring the meat-offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%9%%And the priest shall take from the meat-offering a memorial of it, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%10%%And that which is left of the meat-offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy, of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%11%%No meat-offering which ye shall bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%12%%As for the oblation of the first-fruits, ye shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%13%%And every oblation of thy meat-offering shalt thou season with salt: neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat-offering: with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%14%%And if thou shalt offer a meat-offering of thy first-fruits to the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat-offering of thy first-fruits, green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%15%%And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense upon it: it is a meat-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%2%%16%%And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of its beaten corn, and part of its oil, with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%3%%1%%And if his oblation shall be a sacrifice of peace-offering, if he shall offer it of the herd, whether a male or female; he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%3%%2%%And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%3%%3%%And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace-offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%1%%And if a soul shall sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and be a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he doth not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%12%%Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: it is a sin-offering.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%15%%If a soul shall commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass to the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%16%%And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add to it the fifth part, and give it to the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%17%%And if a soul shall sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%19%%It is a trespass-offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%20%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%21%%If a soul shall sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie to his neighbor, in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbor;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%22%%Or hath found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%23%%Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by force, or the thing which he obtained by deceit, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%24%%Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add to it the fifth part more, and give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%25%%And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%5%%26%%And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%2%%Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: It is the burnt-offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%3%%And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%4%%And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%5%%And the fire upon the altar shall be burning on it; it shall not be extinguished: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt-offering in order upon it; and he shall burn on it the fat of the peace-offerings.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%9%%And the remainder of it shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%10%%It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it to them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; It is most holy, as is the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%11%%All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%12%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%13%%This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half of it at night.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%14%%In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baked, thou shalt bring it in: and the baked pieces of the meat-offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savor to the LORD.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%16%%For every meat-offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%17%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%18%%Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: In the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%19%%The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%20%%Whatever shall touch the flesh of it shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of its blood upon any garment, thou shalt wash that on which it was sprinkled in the holy place.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%21%%But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken: and if it shall be boiled in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%6%%23%%And no sin-offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to make reconciliation in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%7%%As the sin-offering is, so is the trespass-offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement with it shall have it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%8%%And the priest that offereth any man's burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%9%%And all the meat-offering that is baked in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%10%%And every meat-offering mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%18%%And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings shall be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed to him that offereth it; it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%19%%And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that shall be clean shall eat of it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%20%%But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings that pertain to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%25%%For whoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%26%%Moreover, ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%27%%Whatever soul it may be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%28%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%29%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings to the LORD, shall bring his oblation to the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%30%%His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, that shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before the LORD.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%33%%He among the sons' of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%34%%For the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons, by a statute for ever, from among the children of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%7%%35%%This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister to the LORD in the priest's office;

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%6%%And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%7%%And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it to him with it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%8%%And he put the breast-plate upon him: also he put in the breast-plate the Urim and the Thummim.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%9%%And he put the miter upon his head; also upon the miter, even upon his front, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%10%%And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and sanctified them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%11%%And he sprinkled part of it upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, both the laver and its foot, to sanctify them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%12%%And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%13%%And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%14%%And he brought the bullock for the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%15%%And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%16%%And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%17%%But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%18%%And he brought the ram for the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%19%%And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%20%%And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%21%%And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-sacrifice for a sweet savor, and an offering made by fire to the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%22%%And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%23%%And he slew it; and Moses took of its blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%24%%And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%25%%And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%26%%And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%27%%And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave-offering before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%28%%And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savor: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%29%%And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses's part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%30%%And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%31%%And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation; and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%32%%And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%33%%And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration shall be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%34%%As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%35%%Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%8%%36%%So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%1%%And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%2%%And he said to Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%3%%And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%4%%Also a bullock and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat-offering mingled with oil: for to-day the LORD will appear to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%5%%And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%6%%And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%7%%And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%8%%Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%9%%And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%10%%But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%11%%And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%12%%And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%13%%And they presented the burnt-offering to him, with the pieces of it, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%14%%And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%15%%And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin-offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%16%%And he brought the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the manner.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%17%%And he brought the meat-offering, and took a handful of it, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt-sacrifice of the morning.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%18%%He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled around upon the altar,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%19%%And the fat of the bullock, and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%20%%And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%21%%And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%22%%And Aaron lifted up his hand towards the people, and blessed them; and came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and peace-offerings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%23%%And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%9%%24%%And there came out a fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: which, when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%1%%And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire in it, and put incense on it, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%2%%And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%3%%Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%4%%And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%5%%So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%6%%And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%7%%And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%8%%And the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%9%%Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%10%%And that ye may make a difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%11%%And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%12%%And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat-offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%13%%And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%14%%And the wave-breast and heave-shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%15%%The heave-shoulder and the wave-breast shall they bring, with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%16%%And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%17%%Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%18%%Behold, the blood of it was not brought within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%19%%And Aaron said to Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to day, would it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%10%%20%%And when Moses heard that, he was content.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%3%%Whatever parteth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that shall ye eat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%4%%Nevertheless, these shall ye not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%5%%And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%6%%And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof: he is unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%7%%And the swine, though he divideth the hoof, and is cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%8%%Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%9%%These shall ye eat, of all that are in the waters: whatever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%10%%And all that have not fins nor scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living animal which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination to you:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%11%%They shall be even an abomination to you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%12%%Whatever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%13%%And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%14%%And the vultur, and the kite after his kind;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%15%%Every raven after his kind;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%16%%And the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%17%%And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%18%%And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier-eagle,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%19%%And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%20%%All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%21%%Yet these may ye eat, of every flying creeping animal that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap with upon the earth;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%22%%Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the beetle after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%23%%But all other flying creeping animals, which have four feet, shall be an abomination to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%24%%And for these ye shall be unclean: whoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%25%%And whoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%26%%The carcasses of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not cloven-footed, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean to you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%27%%And whatever goeth upon its paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean to you: whoever toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%28%%And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: they are unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%29%%These also shall be unclean to you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise, after its kind,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%30%%And the ferret and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%31%%These are unclean to you among all that creep: whoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%32%%And upon whatever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it is any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it is, in which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; so it shall be cleansed.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%33%%And every earthen vessel, into which any of them falleth, whatever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%34%%Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drank in every such vessel, shall be unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%35%%And every thing on which any part of their carcass falleth, shall be unclean; whether an oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%36%%Nevertheless, a fountain or pit, in which there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%37%%And if any part of their carcass shall fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%38%%But if any water shall be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcass shall fall on it, it shall be unclean to you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%39%%And if any beast, of which ye may eat, shall die; he that toucheth its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%40%%And he that eateth of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening; he also that beareth its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%41%%And every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%42%%Whatever goeth upon the belly, and whatever goeth upon all four, or whatever hath more feet among all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%43%%Ye shall not make your selves abominable with any creeping animal that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled by them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%44%%For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%45%%For I am the LORD that bringeth you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%46%%This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%11%%47%%To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a woman hath conceived seed, and borne a male-child; then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%3%%And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%4%%And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days: she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%5%%But if she shall bear a female-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying sixty six days.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%6%%And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%7%%Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath borne a male or a female.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%12%%8%%And if she shall not be able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%2%%When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%3%%And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight is deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%4%%If the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight, not deeper than the skin, and the hair of it not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%5%%And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and behold, if the plague in his sight is at a stay, and the plague spreadeth not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%6%%And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and behold, if the plague is somewhat dark, and the plague spreadeth not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%7%%But if the scab shall spread much in the skin, after he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%8%%And if the priest shall see, that behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%9%%When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%10%%And the priest shall see him: and behold, if the rising is white in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the rising;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%11%%It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up; for he is unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%12%%And if a leprosy shall break out in the skin, and the leprosy shall cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looketh;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%13%%Then the priest shall consider: and behold, if the leprosy hath covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%14%%But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%15%%And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%16%%Or if the raw flesh shall turn again, and be changed into white, he shall come to the priest;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%17%%And the priest shall see him: and behold, if the plague is turned into white: then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%18%%The flesh also, in which, even in the skin of it, was a boil, and is healed,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%19%%And in the place of the boil there shall be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%20%%And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it is in sight lower than the skin, and the hair of it is turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%13%%21%%But if the priest shall look on it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and if it is not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%4%%Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive, and clean, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%5%%And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel, over running water.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%6%%As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar-wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them, and the living bird, in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%8%%And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%9%%But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head, and his beard, and his eye-brows, even all his hair he shall shave off; and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%10%%And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth-parts of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%11%%And the priest that maketh him clean, shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%13%%And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the holy-place: for as the sin-offering is the priest's, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%14%%And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%15%%And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%19%%And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%20%%And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%21%%And if he is poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth-part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat-offering, and a log of oil;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%22%%And two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%34%%When ye shall have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%35%%And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, it seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%36%%Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest shall enter to see the plague, that all that is in the house may not be made unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%37%%And he shall look on the plague, and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house, with hollow streaks, greenish, or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%39%%And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and behold, if the plague is spread in the walls of the house;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%40%%Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%41%%And he shall cause the house to be scraped within on all sides, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%42%%And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%43%%And if the plague shall return, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%44%%Then the priest shall come and look; and behold, if the plague is spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%45%%And he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house: and he shall carry them forth out of the city to an unclean place.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%46%%Moreover, he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up, shall be unclean until the evening.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%48%%And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%49%%And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar-wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%50%%And he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel, over running water:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%14%%51%%And he shall take the cedar-wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%12%%And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%13%%And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he may not die.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%14%%And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat eastward: and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%15%%Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%16%%And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%17%%And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he shall come out, and shall have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%18%%And he shall go out to the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%19%%And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%20%%And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%21%%And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%22%%And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities to a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%23%%And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%24%%And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%25%%And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%26%%And he that let go the goat for the scape-goat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%27%%And the bullock for the sin-offering, and the goat for the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%28%%And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%29%%And this shall be a statute for ever to you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%30%%For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%31%%It shall be a sabbath of rest to you, and ye shall afflict your souls by a statute for ever.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%32%%And the priest whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%33%%And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar: and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%16%%34%%And this shall be an everlasting statute to you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%2%%Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%3%%Whatever man there may be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%4%%And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%5%%To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to the priest, and offer them for peace-offerings to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%6%%And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%7%%And they shall no more offer their sacrifices to idols, with which they have committed idolatry: This shall be a statute for ever to them throughout their generations.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%8%%And thou shalt say to them, Whatever man there may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%9%%And bringeth it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it to the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%10%%And whatever man there may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%11%%For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%12%%Therefore I said to the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%13%%And whatever man there may be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, who hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%14%%For it is the life of all flesh, the blood of it is for the life of it; therefore I said to the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is its blood: whoever eateth it shall be cut off.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%15%%And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, (whether it is one of your own country, or a stranger) he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening; then shall he be clean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%17%%16%%But if he doth not wash them, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%3%%After the doings of the land of Egypt in which ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%4%%Ye shall perform my judgments, and keep my ordinances, to walk in them; I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%5%%Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments: which if a man doeth, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%6%%None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%7%%The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%8%%The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%9%%The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%10%%The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thy own nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%11%%The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten by thy father, (she is thy sister) thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%12%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%13%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%14%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thy aunt.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%15%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%16%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%17%%Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%18%%Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness besides the other in her life-time.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%19%%Also thou shalt not approach to a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%20%%Moreover, thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbor's wife, to defile thyself with her.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%21%%And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%22%%Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%23%%Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%24%%Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%25%%And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%26%%Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%27%%(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, who were before you, and the land is defiled;)
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%28%%That the land may not vomit you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%29%%For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%18%%30%%Therefore shall ye keep my ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves in them; I am the LORD your God.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%2%%Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%3%%Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%4%%Turn ye not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%5%%And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%6%%It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught shall remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%7%%And if it shall be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%8%%Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%9%%And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%10%%And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%11%%Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%12%%And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%13%%Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%14%%Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%15%%Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%16%%Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor; I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%17%%Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor, and not suffer sin upon him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%18%%Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself; I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%19%%Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle engender with a diverse kind: Thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come upon thee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%20%%And whoever lieth carnally with a woman that is a bond-maid betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged: they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%21%%And he shall bring his trespass-offering to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%22%%And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done; and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%23%%And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food; then ye shall count its fruit as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%24%%But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy to praise the LORD with.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%25%%And in the fifth year shall ye eat of its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%26%%Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%27%%Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%28%%Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%29%%Do not prostitute thy daughter to cause her to be a harlot: lest the land should fall to lewdness, and the land become full of wickedness.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%30%%Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%31%%Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%32%%Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%33%%And if a stranger shall sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not oppress him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%34%%But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be to you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%35%%Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in weight, in measure of length or of capacity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%36%%Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%19%%37%%Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%2%%Again thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed to Molech, he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%3%%And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%4%%And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed to Molech, and kill him not;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%5%%Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to commit lewdness with Molech from among their people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%6%%And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go astray after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%7%%Sanctify yourselves therefore and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%8%%And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD who sanctify you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%9%%For every one that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%10%%And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%11%%And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness; both of them shall surely be put to death: their blood shall be upon them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%12%%And if a man shall lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%13%%If a man also shall lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%14%%And if a man shall take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they: that there be no wickedness among you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%15%%And if a man shall lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%16%%And if a woman shall approach to any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman and the beast; they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%17%%And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%18%%And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%19%%And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%20%%And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%21%%And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%22%%Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein, may not vomit you out.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%23%%And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nations which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%24%%But I have said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, who have separated you from other people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%25%%Ye shall therefore distinguish between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl, or by any manner of living animal that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%26%%And ye shall be holy to me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%20%%27%%A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%1%%And the LORD said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%2%%But for his kin, that is near to him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%3%%And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh to him, who hath had no husband: for her he may be defiled.

1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%7%%They shall not take a wife that is a lewd woman, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy to his God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%8%%Thou shalt sanctify him therefore, for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy to thee: for I the LORD, who sanctify you, am holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%9%%And the daughter of any priest, if she shall profane herself by lewdness, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%10%%And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%11%%Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%12%%Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%13%%And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%14%%A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or a harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people for a wife.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%15%%Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%16%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%17%%Speak to Aaron, saying, whoever he may be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%18%%For whatever man he may be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%19%%Or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%20%%Or crooked-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his peculiar members broken:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%21%%No man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire; he hath a blemish, he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%22%%He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%23%%Only he shall not go in to the vail, nor come nigh to the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he may not profane my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%21%%24%%And Moses told it to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%2%%Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow to me: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%3%%Say to them, Whoever he may be of all your seed among your generations, that approacheth the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow to the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%4%%Whatever man of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean. And whoever toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%5%%Or whoever toucheth any creeping animal, by which he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he hath:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%6%%The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until evening, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he shall wash his flesh with water.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%7%%And when the sun is set, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it is his food.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%8%%That which dieth of itself, or is torn by beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself with it: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%9%%They shall therefore keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%10%%There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%11%%But if the priest shall buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%12%%If the priest's daughter also shall be married to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%13%%But if the priest's daughter shall be a widow, or divorced, and shall have no child, and have returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat; but there shall no stranger eat of it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%14%%And if a man shall eat of the holy thing unknowingly, then he shall put to it the fifth part, and shall give it to the priest, with the holy thing.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%15%%And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they offer to the LORD;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%16%%Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%17%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%18%%Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whoever he may be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his free-will-offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt-offering:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%19%%Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%20%%But whatever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%21%%And whoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a free-will-offering in beeves, or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted: there shall be in it no blemish.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%22%%Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%23%%Either a bullock, or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a free-will-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%24%%Ye shall not offer to the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%25%%Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes are in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%26%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%27%%When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%28%%And whether it is cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%29%%And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%30%%On the same day it shall be eaten up, ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%31%%Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%32%%Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD who hallow you,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%22%%33%%That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%3%%Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, a holy convocation: ye shall do no work in it: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%4%%These are the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%5%%In the fourteenth day of the first month at evening is the LORD'S passover.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%6%%And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to the LORD, seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%7%%In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work in it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%8%%But ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation, ye shall do no servile work in it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%9%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%10%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest to the priest:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%11%%And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%12%%And ye shall offer, that day when ye wave the sheaf, a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%13%%And the meat-offering thereof shall be two tenth-parts of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to the LORD for a sweet savor: and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%14%%And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the same day that ye have brought an offering to your God: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%15%%And ye shall count to you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%16%%Even to the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%17%%Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, they are the first-fruits to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%18%%And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt-offering to the LORD, with their meat-offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%19%%Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%20%%And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%21%%And ye shall proclaim on the same day, that it may be a holy convocation to you: ye shall do no servile work in it. it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%22%%And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them to the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%23%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%24%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%25%%Ye shall do no servile work in it; but ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%26%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%27%%Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%28%%And ye shall do no work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%29%%For whatever soul it may be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%30%%And whatever soul it may be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%31%%Ye shall do no manner of work. It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%32%%It shall be to you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month at evening: from evening to evening shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%33%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%34%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%35%%On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work in it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%36%%Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you, and ye shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work in it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%37%%These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meat-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, every thing upon its day:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%38%%Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your free-will-offerings, which ye give to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%39%%Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%40%%And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%41%%And ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%42%%Ye shall dwell in booths seven days: all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%43%%That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%23%%44%%And Moses declared to the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%2%%Command the children of Israel, that they bring to thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%3%%Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening to the morning before the LORD continually: It shall be a statute for ever in your generations.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%4%%Ye shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%5%%And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth-parts shall be in one cake.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%6%%And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%7%%And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%8%%Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%9%%And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%10%%And the son of an Israelitish woman whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%11%%And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed: and they brought him to Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%12%%And they put him in custody, that the mind of the LORD might be shown to them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%13%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%14%%Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%15%%And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%16%%And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%17%%And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%18%%And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%19%%And if a man shall cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%20%%Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%21%%And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%22%%Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%24%%23%%And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones: and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%3%%Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%4%%But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest to the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%5%%That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest, thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest to the land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%6%%And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%7%%And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase of it be food.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%8%%And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years to thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to thee forty and nine years.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%9%%Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound, on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%10%%And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants: it shall be a jubilee to you; and ye shall return every man to his possession, and ye shall return every man to his family.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%11%%A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be to you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%12%%For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy to you: ye shall eat the increase of it out of the field.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%13%%In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man to his possession.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%14%%And if thou shalt sell aught to thy neighbor, or buy aught of thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%15%%According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, and according to the number of years of the fruits he shall sell to thee:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%16%%According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price of it, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell to thee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%17%%Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%18%%Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%19%%And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell in it in safety.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%20%%And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our increase:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%21%%Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%22%%And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of old fruit until the ninth year; until its fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%23%%The land shall not be sold for ever; for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%24%%And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%25%%If thy brother shall have become poor, and have sold some of his possession, and if any of his kin shall come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%26%%And if the man shall have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%27%%Then let him count the years of the sale of it, and restore the overplus to the man to whom he sold it; that he may return to his possession.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%28%%But if he shall not be able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%29%%And if a man shall sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold: within a full year may he redeem it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%30%%And if it shall not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%31%%But the houses of the villages which have no walls around them, shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%32%%Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%33%%And if a man shall purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%34%%But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%35%%And if thy brother shall have become poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he may be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%36%%Take thou no interest of him, or increase; but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%37%%Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%38%%I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%39%%And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee shall have become poor, and be sold to thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%40%%But as a hired servant, and as a sojourner he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee to the year of jubilee.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%41%%And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers shall he return.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%42%%For they are my servants, which I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as bond-men.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%43%%Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%44%%Both thy bond-men, and thy bond-maids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are around you; of them shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%45%%Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%46%%And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession, they shall be your bond-men for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigor.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%47%%And if a sojourner or a stranger shall become rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him shall become poor, and sell himself to the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%48%%After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%49%%Either his uncle, or his uncle's son may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin to him of his family, may redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%50%%And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the year that he was sold to him, to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%51%%If there shall be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%52%%And if there shall remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%53%%And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%54%%And if he shall not be redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he, and his children with him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%25%%55%%For to me the children of Israel are servants, they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%1%%Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%2%%Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%3%%If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%4%%Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%5%%And your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%6%%And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid the land of evil beasts, neither shall the sword go through your land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%7%%And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%8%%And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%9%%For I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%10%%And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%11%%And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%12%%And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%13%%I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bond-men, and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%14%%But if ye will not hearken to me, and will not do all these commandments;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%15%%And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul shall abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%16%%I also will do this to you, I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%17%%And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%18%%And if ye will not yet for all this hearken to me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%19%%And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%20%%And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%21%%And if ye shall walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%22%%I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your high-ways shall be desolate.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%23%%And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary to me;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%24%%Then will I also walk contrary to you, and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%25%%And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you: and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%26%%And when I have broke the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%27%%And if ye will not for all this hearken to me, but walk contrary to me;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%28%%Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%29%%And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%30%%And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%31%%And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%32%%And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%33%%And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%34%%Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%35%%As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%36%%And upon them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall, when none pursueth.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%37%%And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%38%%And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%39%%And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%40%%If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%41%%And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts shall be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%42%%Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%43%%The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%44%%And yet for all that, when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%45%%But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%26%%46%%These are the statutes, and judgments, and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD, by thy estimation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%3%%And thy estimation shall be, of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%4%%And if it shall be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%5%%And if it shall be from five years old even to twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%6%%And if it shall be from a month old even to five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%7%%And if it shall be from sixty years old and above; if a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%8%%But if he shall be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him: according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%9%%And if it shall be a beast of which men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man giveth of such to the LORD shall be holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%10%%He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange of it shall be holy.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%11%%And if it shall be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%12%%And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%13%%But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part of it to thy estimation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%14%%And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%15%%And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be his.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%16%%And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed of it: a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%17%%If he shall sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%18%%But if he shall sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%19%%And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%20%%And if he will not redeem the field, or if he shall have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%21%%But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted: the possession of it shall be the priest's.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%22%%And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%23%%Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of thy estimation, even to the year of the jubilee, and he shall give thy estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%24%%In the year of the jubilee, the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belonged.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%25%%And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%26%%Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'S.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%27%%And if it shall be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add to it a fifth part of it: or if it shall be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%28%%Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%29%%None devoted, which shall be devoted by men, shall be redeemed: but shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%30%%And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%31%%And if a man will at all redeem aught of his tithes, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%32%%And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%33%%He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he shall change it at all, then both it and the change of it shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
1000005%%Leviticus%%OT%%27%%34%%These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%2%%Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their poll:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%3%%From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel; thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%4%%And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%5%%And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: Of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%6%%Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%7%%Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%9%%Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%10%%Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of Ammihud; of Manasseh; Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%11%%Of Benjamin; Abidan the son of Gideoni.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%14%%Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%15%%Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%16%%These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%17%%And Moses and Aaron took these men who are expressed by their names:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%18%%And they assembled all the congregation on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%19%%As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%47%%But the Levites, after the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%48%%For the LORD had spoken to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%49%%Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%50%%But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all its vessels, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels, and they shall minister to it, and shall encamp around the tabernacle.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%51%%And when the tabernacle moveth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%52%%And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%53%%But the Levites shall pitch around the tabernacle of testimony; that there may be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%1%%54%%And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%2%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%22%%And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to perish. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%23%%And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%24%%And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%25%%Then the priest shall take the jealousy-offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%26%%And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, even the memorial of it, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%27%%And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she is defiled, and hath done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall perish: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%28%%And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%29%%This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%30%%Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%5%%31%%Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%3%%He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%4%%All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine-tree, from the kernels even to the husk.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%5%%All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days shall be fulfilled, in which he separateth himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%6%%All the days that he separateth himself to the LORD, he shall come at no dead body.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%7%%He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%8%%All the days of his separation he is holy to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%9%%And if any man shall die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%10%%And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%11%%And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%12%%And he shall consecrate to the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass-offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%13%%And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%14%%And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he-lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%15%%And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat-offering and their drink-offerings.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%16%%And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%17%%And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat-offering, and his drink-offering.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%18%%And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%19%%And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%20%%And the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave-breast, and heave-shoulder: and after that, the Nazarite may drink wine.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%21%%This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides that which his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%22%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%23%%Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying to them,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%24%%The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%25%%The LORD make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious to thee:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%26%%The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%6%%27%%And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%1%%And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all its instruments, both the altar and all its vessels, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%2%%That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%3%%And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%4%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%5%%Take it of them, that they may be to perform the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%6%%And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%7%%Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%8%%And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%9%%But to the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%10%%And the princes offered for dedicating the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%7%%11%%And the LORD said to Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%16%%For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%17%%For all the first born of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%19%%And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there may be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh to the sanctuary.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%24%%This is it that belongeth to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%25%%And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service of it, and shall serve no more:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%8%%26%%But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do to the Levites concerning their charge.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%3%%In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all its rites, and according to all its ceremonies, shall ye keep it.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%5%%And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%6%%And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%7%%And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%8%%And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%9%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%10%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%11%%The fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%12%%They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%13%%But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%14%%And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner of it, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%15%%And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%16%%So it was always; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%17%%And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%18%%At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%19%%And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%20%%And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%21%%And so it was, when the cloud abode from evening to the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%22%%Or whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining upon it, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%9%%23%%At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%2%%Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%3%%And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%4%%And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, who are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble themselves to thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%5%%When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%6%%When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%7%%But when the congregation is to be convened, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%8%%And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%9%%And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%10%%Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%11%%And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%12%%And the children of Israel took their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%13%%And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%14%%In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%15%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%16%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%17%%And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari moved forward, bearing the tabernacle.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%18%%And the standard of the camp of Reuben moved forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%19%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%20%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%21%%And the Kohathites moved forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other set up the tabernacle against they came.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%22%%And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim moved forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%23%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%24%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%25%%And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan moved forward, which was the rear-ward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%26%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%27%%And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%28%%Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they moved forward.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%29%%And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses's father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it to you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%30%%And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%31%%And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%32%%And it shall be, if thou wilt go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%33%%And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to seek a resting-place for them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%34%%And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%35%%And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, Arise, LORD, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%10%%36%%And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%1%%And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; and the LORD heard it: and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%2%%And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%3%%And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%4%%And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%5%%We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%6%%But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%7%%And the manna was as coriander-seed, and the color of it as the color of bdellium.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%8%%And the people went about, and gathered it and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%9%%And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%10%%Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly: Moses also was displeased.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%11%%And Moses said to the LORD, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%12%%Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%13%%Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%14%%I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%15%%And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%16%%And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%17%%And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%18%%And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%19%%Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%20%%But even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%21%%And Moses said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%22%%Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%23%%And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%24%%And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%25%%And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%26%%But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%27%%And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%28%%And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%29%%And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%30%%And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%31%%And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%32%%And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%33%%And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%34%%And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%11%%35%%And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%1%%And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married: for he had married a Cushite woman.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%2%%And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoke only by Moses? hath he not spoke also by us? And the LORD heard it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%3%%(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%4%%And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%5%%And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%6%%And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%7%%My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%8%%With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%9%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%10%%And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%11%%And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%12%%Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%13%%And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%14%%And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received again.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%15%%And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%12%%16%%And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%2%%Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%3%%And Moses, by the commandment of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%4%%And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%5%%Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%6%%Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%7%%Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%8%%Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%9%%Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%10%%Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%11%%Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manassah, Gaddi the son of Susi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%12%%Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%13%%Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%14%%Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%15%%Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%16%%These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%17%%And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go ye up this way southward, and ascend the mountain:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%18%%And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%19%%And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%20%%And what the land is, whether it is fertile or barren, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%21%%So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%22%%And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%23%%And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%24%%The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%25%%And they returned from exploring the land after forty days.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%26%%And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%27%%And they told him, and said, We came to the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%28%%Nevertheless, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%29%%The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%30%%And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%31%%But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%32%%And they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to search it, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%13%%33%%And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%1%%And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%2%%And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, O that we had died in the land of Egypt! or O that we had died in this wilderness!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%3%%And why hath the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%4%%And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%5%%Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%6%%And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%7%%And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%8%%If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%9%%Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense has departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%10%%But all the congregation required to stone them with stones: and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%11%%And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%12%%I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%13%%And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%14%%And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%15%%Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%16%%Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%17%%And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%18%%The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%19%%Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%20%%And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%21%%But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%22%%Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%23%%Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%24%%But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%25%%(Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and pass into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%26%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%27%%How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%28%%Say to them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%29%%Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%30%%Doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%31%%But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%32%%But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%33%%And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your lewd deeds, until your carcasses shall be wasted in the wilderness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%34%%After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days (each day for a year) shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%35%%I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered against me: in this wilderness, they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%36%%And the men whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing a slander upon the land,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%37%%Even those men that brought the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%38%%But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%39%%And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%40%%And they rose early in the morning, and ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%41%%And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%42%%Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%43%%For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%44%%But they presumed to go up to the hill-top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%14%%45%%Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye shall have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%3%%And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free-will-offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%4%%Then shall he that offereth his offering to the LORD bring a meat-offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%5%%And the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt-offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%6%%Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat-offering two tenth parts of flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%7%%And for a drink-offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin of wine, for a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%8%%And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace-offerings to the LORD:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%9%%Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat-offering of three tenth parts of flour mingled with half a hin of oil.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%10%%And thou shalt bring for a drink-offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%11%%Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%12%%According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%13%%All that are born in the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%14%%And if a stranger shall sojourn with you, or whoever shall be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%15%%One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%16%%One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%17%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%18%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%19%%Then it shall be, that when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up a heave-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%20%%Ye shall offer a cake of the first of your dough for a heave-offering: as ye do the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye heave it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%21%%Of the first of your dough ye shall give to the LORD a heave-offering in your generations.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%22%%And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments which the LORD hath spoken to Moses,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%23%%Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%24%%Then it shall be, if aught shall be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet savor to the LORD, with his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%25%%And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%26%%And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%27%%And if any soul shall sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she-goat of the first year for a sin-offering.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%28%%And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%29%%Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%30%%But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%31%%Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%32%%And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath-day.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%33%%And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%34%%And they put him in custody, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%35%%And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%36%%And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%37%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%38%%Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribin of blue:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%39%%And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%40%%That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%15%%41%%I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%1%%Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%2%%And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%3%%And they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then do ye raise yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%4%%And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%5%%And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to-morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%6%%This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%7%%And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%8%%And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%9%%Seemeth it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%10%%And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%11%%For which cause both thou and all thy company are assembled against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%12%%And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: who said, We will not come up:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%13%%Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%14%%Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%15%%And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%16%%And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%17%%And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each of you his censer.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%18%%And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%19%%And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%20%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%21%%Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%22%%And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%23%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%24%%Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%25%%And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%26%%And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%27%%So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%28%%And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works: for I have not done them of my own mind.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%29%%If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%30%%But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%31%%And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%32%%And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%33%%They, and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%34%%And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%35%%And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%36%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%37%%Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%38%%The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%39%%And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%40%%To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%41%%But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%42%%And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%43%%And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%44%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%45%%Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%46%%And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%47%%And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%48%%And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%49%%Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%16%%50%%And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%3%%And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%4%%And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%5%%And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, by which they murmur against you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%6%%And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%7%%And Moses laid the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%8%%And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%9%%And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%10%%And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again, before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%11%%And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%12%%And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%17%%13%%Whoever approacheth the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%1%%And the LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%2%%And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%3%%And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%4%%And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh to you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%5%%And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%6%%And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%7%%Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%8%%And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%9%%This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%10%%In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%11%%And this is thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%12%%All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%13%%And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%14%%Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%15%%Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether of men or beast, shall be thine: nevertheless, the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%16%%And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%17%%But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%18%%And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder are thine
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%19%%All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to thee and to thy seed with thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%20%%And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%21%%And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%22%%Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%23%%But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%24%%But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%25%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%26%%Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%27%%And this your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%28%%Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD'S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%29%%Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, even its hallowed part out of it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%30%%Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%31%%And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%18%%32%%And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%2%%This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and upon which never came a yoke:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%3%%And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%4%%And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%5%%And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%6%%And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%7%%Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%8%%And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%9%%And a man that is clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and lay them without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%10%%And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%11%%He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%12%%He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he shall not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%13%%Whoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%14%%This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%15%%And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%16%%And whoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%17%%And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put to it in a vessel:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%18%%And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%19%%And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%20%%But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him: he is unclean.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%21%%And it shall be a perpetual statute to them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%19%%22%%And whatever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until the evening.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%1%%Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%2%%And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%3%%And the people chid with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%4%%And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%5%%And why have ye conducted us from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%6%%And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%7%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%8%%Take the rod, and convene thou the assembly, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give drink to the congregation and their beasts.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%9%%And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%10%%And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%11%%And Moses lifted his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%12%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%13%%This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%14%%And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%15%%How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%16%%And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%17%%Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high-way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%18%%And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%19%%And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%20%%And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%21%%Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%22%%And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%23%%And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%24%%Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%25%%Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%26%%And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%27%%And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they ascended mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%28%%And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%20%%29%%And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%1%%And when king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%2%%And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%3%%And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%4%%And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%5%%And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul lotheth this light bread.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%6%%And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%7%%Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%8%%And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%9%%And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%10%%And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in Oboth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%11%%And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, towards the sun-rising.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%12%%From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%13%%From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%14%%Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%15%%And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%16%%And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%17%%Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%18%%The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%19%%And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%20%%And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towards Jeshimon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%21%%And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%22%%Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high-way, until we have past thy borders.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%23%%And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%24%%And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%25%%And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%26%%For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%27%%Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%28%%For there has a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%29%%Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%30%%We have shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reacheth to Medeba.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%31%%Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%32%%And Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that were there.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%33%%And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%34%%And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%21%%35%%So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left to him alive: and they possessed his land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%1%%And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%2%%And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%3%%And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%4%%And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are around us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%5%%He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there has a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%6%%Come now therefore, I pray thee, Curse for me this people; for they are too mighty for me: it may be I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%7%%And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%8%%And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%9%%And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%10%%And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%11%%Behold, there has a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse them for me: it may be I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%12%%And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%13%%And Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Depart into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%14%%And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%15%%And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%16%%And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%17%%For I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%18%%And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%19%%Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%20%%And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to thee, that shalt thou perform.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%21%%And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%22%%And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%23%%And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%24%%But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%25%%And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%26%%And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%27%%And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%28%%And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%29%%And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%30%%And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast rid ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, Nay.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%31%%Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%32%%And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%33%%And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%34%%And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displeaseth thee, I will return again.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%35%%And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%36%%And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost limit.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%37%%And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%38%%And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I have come to thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%39%%And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%40%%And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%22%%41%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and conducted him to the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%1%%And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%2%%And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%3%%And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go: it may be the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he showeth me I will tell thee. And he went to a high place.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%4%%And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%5%%And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%6%%And he returned to him and lo, he stood by his burnt-sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%7%%And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%8%%How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%9%%For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%10%%Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%11%%And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%12%%And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%13%%And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and from thence curse them for me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%14%%And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%15%%And he said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I meet the LORD yonder.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%16%%And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak, and say thus.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%17%%And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What hath the LORD spoken?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%18%%And he took up his parable, and said, Rise, Balak, and hear; hearken to me, thou son of Zippor:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%19%%God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoke, and shall he not make it good?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%20%%Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%21%%He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel; the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%22%%God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%23%%Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%24%%Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he shall eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%25%%And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%26%%But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%27%%And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will please God that thou mayest from thence curse them for me.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%28%%And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looketh towards Jeshimon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%29%%And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%23%%30%%And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%1%%And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%2%%And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes, and the spirit of God came upon him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%3%%And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%4%%He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%5%%How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%6%%As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign-aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar-trees beside the waters.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%7%%He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%8%%God brought him forth from Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%9%%He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall rouse him? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%10%%And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse my enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%11%%Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee to great honor; but lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honor.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%12%%And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%13%%If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%14%%And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, I will advertise thee what this people will do to thy people in the latter days.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%15%%And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%16%%He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%17%%I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%18%%And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%19%%Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%20%%And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be that he shall perish for ever.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%21%%And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%22%%Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asher shall carry thee away captive.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%23%%And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%24%%And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Ashur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%24%%25%%And Balaam arose, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%1%%And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit lewdness with the daughters of Moab.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%2%%And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%3%%And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%4%%And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%5%%And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined to Baal-peor.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%6%%And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%7%%And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%8%%And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly: So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%9%%And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%10%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%11%%Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, (while he was zealous for my sake among them,) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%12%%Wherefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%13%%And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%14%%Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%15%%And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%16%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%17%%Distress the Midianites, and smite them:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%25%%18%%For they distress you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%26%%1%%And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%26%%2%%Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%26%%3%%And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%26%%4%%Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%27%%17%%Who may go out before them, and who may go in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%27%%18%%And the LORD said to Moses, Take to thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thy hand upon him;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%27%%19%%And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: and give him a charge in their sight.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%28%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%28%%2%%Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savor to me, shall ye observe to offer to me in their due season.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%28%%3%%And thou shalt say to them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%28%%4%%The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at evening.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%1%%And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%2%%And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%3%%If a man shall vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%4%%If a woman also shall vow a vow to the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%5%%And her father shall hear her vow, and her bond with which she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she hath bound her soul shall stand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%6%%But if her father shall disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows or of her bonds with which she hath bound her soul shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%7%%And if she had a husband when she vowed, or uttered aught from her lips, with which she bound her soul;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%8%%And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%9%%But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make of no effect her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul: and the LORD shall forgive her.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%10%%But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%11%%And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%12%%And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%13%%But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%14%%Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%15%%But if her husband altogether holds his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%16%%But if he shall any way make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%30%%17%%These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%2%%Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered to thy people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%3%%And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves for the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD on Midian.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%4%%Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%5%%So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%6%%And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%7%%And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%8%%And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%9%%And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%10%%And they burnt all their cities in which they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%11%%And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%12%%And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%13%%And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%14%%And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, who came from the battle.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%15%%And Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%16%%Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD, in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%17%%Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%18%%But all the female children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%19%%And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whoever hath killed any person, and whoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%20%%And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%21%%And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%22%%Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%23%%Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%24%%And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%25%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%26%%Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%27%%And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%28%%And levy a tribute to the LORD of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%29%%Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for a heave-offering of the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%30%%And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%31%%And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%32%%And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had taken, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%33%%And seventy two thousand beeves,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%34%%And sixty one thousand asses,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%35%%And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%36%%And the half which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%37%%And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy five.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%38%%And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was seventy two.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%39%%And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute was sixty one.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%40%%And the persons were sixteen thousand, of which the LORD'S tribute was thirty and two persons.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%41%%And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD'S heave-offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%42%%And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%43%%(Now the half that pertained to the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%44%%And thirty and six thousand beeves,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%45%%And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%46%%And sixteen thousand persons;)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%47%%Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%48%%And the officers who were over thousands of the hosts, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%49%%And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%50%%We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath obtained of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%51%%And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%52%%And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%53%%(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%31%%54%%And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%1%%Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for cattle;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%2%%The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%3%%Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%4%%Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%5%%Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%6%%And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%7%%And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%8%%Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%9%%For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%10%%And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%11%%Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%12%%Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%13%%And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%14%%And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%15%%For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%16%%And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%17%%But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%18%%We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%19%%For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%20%%And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%21%%And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%22%%And the land shall be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%23%%But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%24%%Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%25%%And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%26%%Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%27%%But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%28%%So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%29%%And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%30%%But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%31%%And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%32%%We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%33%%And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, even the cities of the country around.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%34%%And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%35%%And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%36%%And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities: and folds for sheep.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%37%%And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%38%%And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%39%%And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who was in it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%40%%And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%41%%And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%32%%42%%And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%1%%These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%2%%And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%3%%And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%4%%For the Egyptians buried all their first-born, whom the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%5%%And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%6%%And they departed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%7%%And they removed from Etham, and turned again to Pi-hahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they encamped before Migdol.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%8%%And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%9%%And they removed from Marah, and came to Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm-trees; and they encamped there.

1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%50%%And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%51%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%52%%Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite demolish all their high places:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%53%%And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell in it; for I have given you the land to possess it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%54%%And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%55%%But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be prickles in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall harass you in the land in which ye dwell.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%33%%56%%Moreover, it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you as I thought to do to them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%2%%Command the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with its borders.)
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%3%%Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the border of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%4%%And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: its limit shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%5%%And the border shall form a circuit from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and the limits of it shall be at the sea.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%6%%And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%7%%And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall designate for you mount Hor:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%8%%From mount Hor ye shall designate your border to the entrance of Hamath; and the limits of the border shall be at Zedad:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%9%%And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the limits of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%10%%And ye shall designate your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%11%%And the limit shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%12%%And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the limits of it shall be at the salt sea: This shall be your land with its limits on all sides.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%13%%And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%14%%For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%15%%The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of Jordan near Jericho eastward, towards the sun-rising.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%16%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%17%%These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%18%%And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%19%%And the names of the men are these: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%20%%And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%21%%Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%22%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%23%%The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%24%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%25%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%26%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%27%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%28%%And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%34%%29%%These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%1%%And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%2%%Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities around them.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%3%%And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%4%%And the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits on all sides.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%5%%And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%6%%And among the cities which ye shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the man-slayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%7%%So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%8%%And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%9%%And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%10%%Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%11%%Then ye shall appoint for you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, who killeth any person at unawares.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%12%%And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the man-slayer may not die, until he stands before the congregation in judgment.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%13%%And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%14%%Ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%15%%These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%16%%And if he shall smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%17%%And if he shall smite him by throwing a stone, by which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%18%%Or if he shall smite him with a hand-weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%19%%The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%20%%But if he shall thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying in wait, that he die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%21%%Or in enmity shall smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%22%%But if he shall thrust him suddenly without enmity, or shall have cast upon him any thing without laying in wait,
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%23%%Or with any stone, by which a man may die, seeing him not, and shall cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%24%%Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%25%%And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%26%%But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he had fled;
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%27%%And the avenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood shall kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%28%%Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%29%%So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%30%%Whoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%31%%Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%32%%And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%33%%So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%35%%34%%Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, in which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%1%%And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%2%%And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%3%%And if they shall be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%4%%And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%5%%And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%6%%This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%7%%So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%8%%And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%9%%Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%10%%Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%11%%For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons:
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%12%%And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
1000005%%Numbers%%OT%%36%%13%%These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%1%%These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on the east side of Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against Suf, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%2%%(There are eleven days journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea.)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%3%%And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%4%%After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%5%%On the east side of Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%6%%The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%7%%Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places nigh to it, in the plain, on the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%8%%Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%9%%And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%10%%The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%11%%(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%12%%How can I alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%13%%Take ye wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%14%%And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%15%%So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%16%%And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%17%%Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring to me, and I will hear it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%18%%And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%19%%And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%20%%And I said to you, Ye have come to the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give to us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%21%%Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said to thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%22%%And ye came near to me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall explore the land for us, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%23%%And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%24%%And they turned and ascended the mountain, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and explored it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%25%%And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%26%%Notwithstanding, ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%27%%And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth from the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%28%%Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover, we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%29%%Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%30%%The LORD your God who goeth before you; he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%31%%And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how the LORD thy God bore thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%32%%Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%33%%Who went in the way before you, to search out for you a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%34%%And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and swore, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%35%%Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%36%%Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trod upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%37%%Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%38%%But Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%39%%Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%40%%But as for you, turn ye, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%41%%Then ye answered and said to me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to ascend the hill.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%42%%And the LORD said to me, Say to them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%43%%So I spoke to you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and presumptuously ascended the hill.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%44%%And the Amorites, who dwelt on that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%45%%And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear to you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%1%%46%%So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days that ye abode there.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%1%%Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%2%%And the LORD spoke to me, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%3%%Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%4%%And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: therefore take ye good heed to yourselves:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%5%%Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir to Esau for a possession.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%6%%Ye shall buy food of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%7%%For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee: thou hast lacked nothing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%8%%And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%9%%And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%10%%(The Emims dwelt in it in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%11%%Who also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%12%%The Horims also dwelt formerly in Seir, but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which the LORD gave to them.)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%13%%Now rise, said I, and pass over the brook Zered: and we went over the brook Zered.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%14%%And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we passed the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted from among the host, as the LORD swore to them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%15%%For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%16%%So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%17%%That the LORD spoke to me, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%18%%Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%19%%And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%20%%(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt in it in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%21%%A people great, and many, and tall as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%22%%As he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%23%%And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, who came forth from Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%24%%Arise ye, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thy hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%25%%This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%26%%And I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%27%%Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the highway, I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%28%%Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%29%%(As the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%30%%But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%31%%And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%32%%Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%33%%And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%34%%And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones of every city, we left none to remain.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%35%%Only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%36%%From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even to Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all to us:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%2%%37%%Only to the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor to any place of the river Jabbok, nor to the cities on the mountains, nor to whatever the LORD our God forbad us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%1%%Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%2%%And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%3%%So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%4%%And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%5%%All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%6%%And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%7%%But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%8%%And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%9%%(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%10%%All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%11%%For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%12%%And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%13%%And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%14%%Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%15%%And I gave Gilead to Machir.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%16%%And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%17%%The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%18%%And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%19%%But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%20%%Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%21%%And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%22%%Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%23%%And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%24%%O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%25%%I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%26%%But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%27%%Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%28%%But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%3%%29%%So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%1%%Now therefore hearken, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%2%%Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%3%%Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%4%%But ye who adhered to the LORD your God, are alive every one of you this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%5%%Behold, I have taught you statutes, and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%6%%Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which will hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%7%%For what nation is there so great, which hath God so nigh to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%8%%And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%9%%Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou shouldst forget the things which thy eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them to thy sons, and thy sons' sons:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%10%%Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Assemble the people to me, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%11%%And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%12%%And the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%13%%And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%14%%And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%15%%Take ye therefore good heed to yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%16%%Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make to you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%17%%The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%18%%The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%19%%And lest thou shouldst lift up thy eyes to heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldst be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided to all nations under the whole heaven.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%20%%But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, even from Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%21%%Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not enter that good land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%22%%But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%23%%Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%24%%For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%25%%When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%26%%I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from the land to which ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%27%%And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%28%%And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%29%%But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou shalt seek him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%30%%When thou art in tribulation, and all these things have come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient to his voice;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%31%%(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he swore to them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%32%%For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%33%%Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%34%%Or hath God essayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%35%%To thee it was shown, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none besides him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%36%%Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee; and upon earth he showed thee his great fire; and thou heardst his words from the midst of the fire.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%37%%And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out of Egypt in his sight with his mighty power.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%38%%To drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%39%%Know therefore this day, and consider it in thy heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%40%%Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%41%%Then Moses set apart three cities on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%42%%That the slayer might flee thither, who should kill his neighbor unawares, and when he had not hated him in times past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%43%%Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%44%%And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%45%%These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, after they came forth from Egypt,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%46%%On the east side of Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they had come forth from Egypt:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%47%%And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on the side of Jordan, towards the sun-rising;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%48%%From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%4%%49%%And all the plain on the side of Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%1%%And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%2%%The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%3%%The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%4%%The LORD talked with you face to face on the mount, from the midst of the fire,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%5%%(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up upon the mount;) saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%6%%I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%7%%Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%8%%Thou shalt not make for thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%9%%Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%10%%And showing mercy to thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%11%%Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%12%%Keep the sabbath-day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%13%%Six days thou shalt labor, and do all thy work:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%14%%But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy man-servant and thy maid-servant may rest as well as thou.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%15%%And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand and by an out-stretched arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath-day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%16%%Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%17%%Thou shalt not kill.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%18%%Neither shalt thou commit adultery.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%19%%Neither shalt thou steal.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%20%%Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%21%%Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbor's house, his field, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbor's.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%22%%These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly on the mount from the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%23%%And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%24%%And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%25%%Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%26%%For who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%27%%Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say; and speak thou to us all that the LORD our God shall speak to thee; and we will hear it, and do it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%28%%And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoke to thee: they have well said all that they have spoken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%29%%O that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%30%%Go, say to them, Return to your tents again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%31%%But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak to thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%32%%Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%5%%33%%Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%1%%Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye may do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%2%%That thou mayst fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life: and that thy days may be prolonged.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%3%%Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%4%%Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God is one LORD:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%5%%And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%6%%And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%7%%And thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%8%%And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%9%%And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%10%%And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%11%%And houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and wells digged, which thou didst not dig, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%12%%Then beware lest thou shouldst forget the LORD, who brought thee forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%13%%Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%14%%Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are around you;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%15%%(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God should be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%16%%Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%17%%Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%18%%And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to thy fathers,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%19%%To cast out all thy enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%20%%And when thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%21%%Then thou shalt say to thy son, We were Pharoah's bond-men in Egypt: and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%22%%And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and distressing, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%23%%And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%24%%And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%6%%25%%And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%1%%When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perrizites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%2%%And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%3%%Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take to thy son.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%4%%For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%5%%But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%6%%For thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people to himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%7%%The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%8%%But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn to your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bond-men, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%9%%Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%10%%And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%11%%Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%12%%Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God will keep to thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%13%%And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless thy children, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thy oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore to thy fathers to give thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%14%%Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%15%%And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt (which thou knowest) upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%16%%And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver to thee; thy eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%17%%If thou shalt say in thy heart, These nations are more than I, how can I dispossess them?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%18%%Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%19%%The great temptations which thy eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the out-stretched arm, by which the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do to all the people of whom thou art afraid.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%20%%Moreover, the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, shall be destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%21%%Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%22%%And the LORD thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%23%%But the LORD thy God shall deliver them to thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they are destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%24%%And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou shalt have destroyed them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%25%%The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to thee, lest thou shouldst be snared in it: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%7%%26%%Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou shouldst be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%1%%All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to your fathers.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%2%%And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God hath led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments, or not.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%3%%And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%4%%Thy raiment hath not become old upon thee, neither hath thy foot swelled these forty years.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%5%%Thou shalt also consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%6%%Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%7%%For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%8%%A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive-oil, and honey;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%9%%A land in which thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%10%%When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%11%%Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%12%%Lest when thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%13%%And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold are increased, and all that thou hast is increased;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%14%%Then thy heart shall be lifted up, and thou shalt forget the LORD thy God (who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%15%%Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drouth, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%16%%Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%17%%And thou shalt say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%18%%But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to thy fathers, as it is this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%19%%And it shall be, if thou shalt at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%8%%20%%As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient to the voice of the LORD your God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%1%%Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%2%%A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard it said, Who can stand before the children of Anak!
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%3%%Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he who goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%4%%Speak not thou in thy heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%5%%Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations, the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD swore to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%6%%Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiff-necked people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%7%%Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart from the land of Egypt, until ye came to this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%8%%Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%9%%When I ascended the mount, to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither ate bread, nor drank water:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%10%%And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words which the LORD spoke with you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%11%%And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%12%%And the LORD said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%13%%Furthermore, the LORD spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%14%%Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%15%%So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%16%%And I looked, and behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%17%%And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%18%%And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I neither ate bread, nor drank water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%19%%(For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.) But the LORD hearkened to me at that time also.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%20%%And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%21%%And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust of it into the brook that descended from the mount.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%22%%And at Taberah, and at Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%23%%Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%24%%Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%25%%Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%26%%I prayed therefore to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%27%%Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%28%%Lest the land from which thou hast brought us should say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%9%%29%%Yet they are thy people and thy inheritance which thou hast brought out by thy mighty power and by thy out-stretched arm.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%1%%At that time the LORD said to me, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me upon the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%2%%And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%3%%And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like the first, and ascended the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%4%%And he wrote on the tables according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount, from the midst of the fire, in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%5%%And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the LORD commanded me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%6%%And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jakan to Mosira: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%7%%From thence they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%8%%At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%9%%Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%10%%And I stayed in the mount, according to the first-time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%11%%And the LORD said to me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%12%%And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%13%%To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%14%%Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belongeth to the LORD thy God, the earth also, with all that it contains.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%15%%Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%16%%Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%17%%For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%18%%He executeth the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%19%%Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%20%%Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%21%%He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thy eyes have seen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%10%%22%%Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%1%%Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, always.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%2%%And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his out-stretched arm,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%3%%And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%4%%And what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them to this day;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%5%%And what he did to you in the wilderness, until ye came to this place;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%6%%And what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%7%%But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%8%%Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%9%%And that ye may prolong your days in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%10%%For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed, and water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%11%%But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%12%%A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%13%%And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%14%%That I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine and thy oil.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%15%%And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%16%%Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%17%%And then the LORD'S wrath shall be kindled against you, and he shall shut up the heaven, that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%18%%Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%19%%And ye shall teach them to your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%20%%And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%21%%That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%22%%For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%23%%Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%24%%Every place on which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your limit be.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%25%%There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you, and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said to you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%26%%Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%27%%A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you this day;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%28%%And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%29%%And it shall come to pass when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in to the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%30%%Are they not on the other side of Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, who dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%31%%For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell in it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%11%%32%%And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%1%%These are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%2%%Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%3%%And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%4%%Ye shall not do so to the LORD your God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%5%%But the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%6%%And thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave-offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your free-will-offerings, and the firstlings of your herds, and of your flocks:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%7%%And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand to, ye and your households, in which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%8%%Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%9%%For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the LORD your God giveth you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%10%%But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies on every side, so that ye dwell in safety:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%11%%Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave-offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow to the LORD:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%12%%And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%13%%Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%14%%But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%15%%Notwithstanding, thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatever thy soul desireth, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat of it as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%16%%Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%17%%Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy free-will-offerings, or heave-offering of thy hand:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%18%%But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands to.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%19%%Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%20%%When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatever thy soul desireth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%21%%If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there, shall be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatever thy soul desireth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%22%%Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%23%%Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%24%%Thou shalt not eat it: thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%25%%Thou shalt not eat it; that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%26%%Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%27%%And thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%28%%Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may be well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%29%%When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%30%%Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they are destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%31%%Thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God; for every abomination to the LORD which he hateth have they done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%12%%32%%Whatever thing I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%1%%If there shall arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and give thee a sign or a wonder.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%2%%And the sign or the wonder shall come to pass, of which he spoke to thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%3%%Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%4%%Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave to him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%5%%And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou remove the evil from the midst of thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%6%%If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, who is as thy own soul, shall entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%7%%Namely, of the gods of the people who are around you, nigh to thee, or far off from thee, from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%8%%Thou shalt not consent to him, nor hearken to him; neither shall thy eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%9%%But thou shalt surely kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%10%%And thou shalt stone him with stones that he shall die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%11%%And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is, among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%12%%If thou shalt hear, in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%13%%Certain men, the children of Belial, have gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%14%%Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and behold, if it is truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%15%%Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is in it, and its cattle, with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%16%%And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of its street, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil of it every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be a heap forever; it shalt not be built again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%17%%And there shall cleave naught of the cursed thing to thy hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn to thy fathers;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%13%%18%%When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%1%%Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%2%%For thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%3%%Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%4%%These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%5%%The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow-deer, and the wild-goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%6%%And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%7%%Nevertheless, these ye shall not eat, of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean to you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%8%%And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, is unclean to you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%9%%These ye shall eat, of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%10%%And whatever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean to you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%11%%Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%12%%But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%13%%And the glede, and the kite, and the vultur after his kind,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%14%%And every raven after his kind,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%15%%And the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%16%%The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%17%%And the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%18%%And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%19%%And every creeping animal that flieth is unclean to you: they shall not be eaten.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%20%%But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%21%%Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it to the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it to an alien: for thou art a holy people to the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%22%%Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%23%%And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%24%%And if the way is too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place is too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%25%%Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go to the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%26%%And thou shalt bestow that money for whatever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thy household.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%27%%And the Levite that is within thy gates, thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%28%%At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thy increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%14%%29%%And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%1%%At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%2%%And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth aught to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%3%%Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thy hand shall release:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%4%%Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%5%%Only if thou shalt carefully hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%6%%For the LORD thy God shall bless thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%7%%If there shall be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD the God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand from thy poor brother:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%8%%But thou shalt open thy hand wide to him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%9%%Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thy eye shall be evil against thy poor brother, and thou shalt give him naught; and he shall cry to the LORD against thee, and it shall be sin to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%10%%Thou shalt surely give him, and thy heart shall not be grieved when thou givest to him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thy hand to.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%11%%For the poor shall never cease from the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thy hand wide to thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%12%%And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, shall be sold to thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%13%%And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him depart empty:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%14%%Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine-press: of that with which the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give to him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%15%%And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%16%%And it shall be, if he shall say to thee, I will not leave thee; because he loveth thee and thy house, because he is well with thee;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%17%%Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear into the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also to thy maid-servant thou shalt do likewise.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%18%%It shall not seem hard to thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been of double the worth of a hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%19%%All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%20%%Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%21%%And if there is any blemish in it, as if it is lame, or blind, or hath any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%22%%Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%15%%23%%Only thou shalt not eat its blood; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%1%%Observe the month Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth from Egypt by night.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%2%%Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%3%%Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth from the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth from the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%4%%And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou didst sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%5%%Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%6%%But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening, at the setting of the sun, at the time of thy departure from Egypt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%7%%And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go to thy tents.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%8%%Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt do no work.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%9%%Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: begin to number the seven weeks from the time when thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%10%%And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the LORD thy God with a tribute of a free-will-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give to the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%11%%And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%12%%And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%13%%Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn, and thy wine.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%14%%And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%15%%Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast to the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy increase, and in all the works of thy hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%16%%Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%17%%Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%18%%Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%19%%Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%20%%That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%21%%Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make for thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%16%%22%%Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%1%%Thou shalt not sacrifice to the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, in which is blemish, or any evil favoredness: for that is an abomination to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%2%%If there shall be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%3%%And hath gone and served other gods, and worshiped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%4%%And it shall be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired diligently, and behold, it is true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%5%%Then shalt thou bring forth to thy gates that man or that woman, who have committed that wicked thing, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%6%%At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%7%%The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt remove the evil from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%8%%If there shall arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and go up to the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%9%%And thou shalt come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show thee the sentence of judgment:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%10%%And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%11%%According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall show thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%12%%And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken to the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt remove the evil from Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%13%%And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%14%%When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell in it, and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%15%%Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, who is not thy brother.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%16%%But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said to you, ye shall henceforth return no more that way.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%17%%Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart may turn not away: neither shall he greatly accumulate to himself silver and gold.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%18%%And it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%19%%And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%17%%20%%That his heart may not be lifted above his brethren, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%1%%The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%2%%Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said to them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%3%%And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether ox or sheep; and they shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%4%%The first-fruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thy oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%5%%For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%6%%And if a Levite shall come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind to the place which the LORD shall choose;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%7%%Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, who stand there before the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%8%%They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%9%%When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%10%%There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%11%%Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%12%%For all that do these things are an abomination to the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%13%%Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%14%%For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened to observers of times, and to diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%15%%The LORD thy God will raise up to thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like to me; to him ye shall hearken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%16%%According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I may not die.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%17%%And the LORD said to me, They have well spoken of that which they have spoken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%18%%I will raise up to them a prophet from among their brethren, like thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them all that I shall command him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%19%%And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not hearken to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%20%%But the prophet, who shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%21%%And if thou shalt say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%18%%22%%When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing doth not follow, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%1%%When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%2%%Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%3%%Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the limits of thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%4%%And this is the case of the slayer, who shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever killeth his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%5%%As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand maketh a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and falleth upon his neighbor, that he dieth: he shall flee to one of these cities, and live:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%6%%Lest the avenger of blood shall pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%7%%Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%8%%And if the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy limits, as he hath sworn to thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give to thy fathers;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%9%%If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, besides these three:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%10%%That innocent blood may not be shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%11%%But if any man shall hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally, that he dieth, and he shall flee into one of these cities:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%12%%Then the elders of his city shall send and bring him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%13%%Thy eye shall not pity him, but thou shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may be well with thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%14%%Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set in thy inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%15%%One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth; at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%16%%If a false witness shall rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%17%%Then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the LORD, before the priests, and the judges, who shall be in those days;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%18%%And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and behold, if the witness is a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%19%%Then shall ye do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother: so shalt thou remove the evil from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%20%%And those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%19%%21%%And thy eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%1%%When thou goest out to battle against thy enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%2%%And it shall be when ye are come nigh to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%3%%And shall say to them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day to battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%4%%For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%5%%And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should dedicate it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%6%%And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return to his house, lest he should die in the battle, and another man should eat of it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%7%%And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he should die in battle, and another man should take her.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%8%%And the officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted? let him go and return to his house, lest his brethren's heart should faint as well as his heart.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%9%%And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking to the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%10%%When thou comest nigh to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%11%%And it shall be, if it shall make thee answer of peace, and open to thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein, shall be tributaries to thee, and they shall serve thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%12%%And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%13%%And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thy hands, thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the sword:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%14%%But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it, shalt thou take to thyself: and thou shalt eat the spoil of thy enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%15%%Thus shalt thou do to all the cities which are very distant from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%16%%But of the cities of these people which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%17%%But thou shalt utterly destroy them, namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%18%%That they may not teach you to do after all their abominations which they have done to their gods; so would ye sin against the LORD your God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%19%%When thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees of it by forcing an ax against them; for thou mayest eat of them: and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%20%%20%%Only the trees which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it shall be subdued.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%1%%If one shall be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%2%%Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure to the cities which are around him that is slain:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%3%%And it shall be that the city which is next to the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%4%%And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a rough valley, which is neither tilled nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%5%%And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near (for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD) and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%6%%And all the elders of that city that are next to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%7%%And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%8%%Be merciful, O LORD, to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood to the charge of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%9%%So shalt thou remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%10%%When thou goest forth to war against thy enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thy hands, and thou hast taken them captive,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%11%%And thou seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire to her, that thou wouldest have her for thy wife:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%12%%Then thou shalt bring her home to thy house, and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%13%%And she shall put off from her the raiment of her captivity, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that, thou shalt go in to her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%14%%And it shall be, if thou shalt have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money; thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%15%%If a man shall have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%16%%Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not prefer the son of the beloved first-born, before the son of the hated, which is indeed the first-born:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%17%%But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the first-born, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%18%%If a man shall have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and who, when they have chastened him, will not hearken to them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%19%%Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%20%%And they shall say to the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%21%%And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he may die: so shalt thou remove evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%22%%And if a man shall have committed a sin worthy of death, and he must be put to death, and thou shalt hang him on a tree:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%21%%23%%His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land may not be defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%1%%Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again to thy brother.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%2%%And if thy brother shall not be nigh to thee, or if thou shalt not know him, then thou shalt bring it to thy own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother shall seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%3%%In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%4%%Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%5%%A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%6%%If a bird's nest shall chance to be before thee in the way on any tree, or on the ground, whether with young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%7%%But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%8%%When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou mayest not bring blood upon thy house, if any man shall fall from thence.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%9%%Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, should be defiled.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%10%%Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%11%%Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%12%%Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, with which thou coverest thyself.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%13%%If any man shall take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%14%%And give occasions of speech against her, and bring an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%15%%Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity to the elders of the city in the gate:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%16%%And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man for a wife, and he hateth her,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%17%%And lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%18%%And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%19%%And they shall amerce him in a hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he hath brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%20%%But if this thing shall be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%21%%Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she may die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to be guilty of lewdness in her father's house: so shalt thou remove evil from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%22%%If a man shall be found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou remove evil from Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%23%%If a damsel that is a virgin shall be betrothed to a husband, and a man shall find her in the city, and lie with her;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%24%%Then ye shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they may die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor's wife: so thou shalt remove evil from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%25%%But if a man shall find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man shall force her, and lie with her; then the man only that lay with her shall die:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%26%%But to the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%27%%For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%28%%If a man shall find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%29%%Then the man that lay with her shall give to the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%22%%30%%A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%1%%He that is wounded or mutilated in his secrets, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%2%%A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%3%%An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%4%%Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth from Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%5%%Nevertheless, the LORD thy God would not hearken to Balaam: but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing to thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%6%%Thou shalt not seek their peace, nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%7%%Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%8%%The children that are begotten by them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%9%%When the host goeth forth against thy enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%10%%If there shall be among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth to him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%11%%But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%12%%Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%13%%And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon: and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig with it, and shalt turn back, and cover that which cometh from thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%14%%For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thy enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he may see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%15%%Thou shalt not deliver to his master the servant who hath escaped from his master to thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%16%%He shall dwell with thee, even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it pleaseth him best: thou shalt not oppress him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%17%%There shall be no harlot of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%18%%Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%19%%Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of money, interest of victuals, interest of any thing that is lent upon interest:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%20%%To a stranger thou mayest lend upon interest; but to thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thy hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%21%%When thou shalt vow a vow to the LORD thy God, thou shalt not defer to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%22%%But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%23%%That which is uttered by thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a free-will-offering, according as thou hast vowed to the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%24%%When thou comest into thy neighbor's vineyard, then thou mayest satisfy thy appetite with grapes at thy own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%23%%25%%When thou comest into the standing-corn of thy neighbor, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thy hand: but thou shalt not move a sickle to thy neighbor's standing-corn.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%1%%When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it shall come to pass that she findeth no favor in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%2%%And when she hath departed from his house, she may go and be another man's wife.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%3%%And if the latter husband shall hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house; or if the latter husband shall die, who took her to be his wife;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%4%%Her former husband who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%5%%When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife which he hath taken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%6%%No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone for a pledge: for he taketh a man's life for a pledge.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%7%%If a man shall be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and shall make merchandise of him, or sell him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt remove evil from among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%8%%Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%9%%Remember what the LORD thy God did to Miriam by the way, after that ye come forth from Egypt.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%10%%When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%11%%Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad to thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%12%%And if the man is poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%13%%In any case thou shalt deliver to him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness to thee before the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%14%%Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he is of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%15%%At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it, for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he should cry against thee to the LORD, and it be sin to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%16%%The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%17%%Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless, nor take a widow's raiment for a pledge:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%18%%But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%19%%When thou cuttest down thy harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%20%%When thou beatest thy olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%21%%When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%24%%22%%And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%1%%If there shall be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%2%%And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%3%%Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%4%%Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%5%%If brethren shall dwell together, and one of them shall die and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him for a wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%6%%And it shall be, that the first-born which she beareth, shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name may not become extinct in Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%7%%And if the man shall not like to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up to his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%8%%Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him: and if he shall stand to it, and say, I like not to take her,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%9%%Then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done to that man that will not build up his brother's house.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%10%%And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%11%%When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near to deliver her husband from the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%12%%Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thy eye shall not pity her.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%13%%Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%14%%Thou shalt not have in thy house divers measures, a great and a small:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%15%%But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have; that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%16%%For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%17%%Remember what Amalek did to thee by the way, when ye had come forth from Egypt;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%18%%How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%25%%19%%Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thy enemies on all sides, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%1%%And it shall be, when thou hast come in to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%2%%That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go to the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%3%%And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those days, and say to him, I profess this day to the LORD thy God, that I have come to the country which the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%4%%And the priest shall take the basket from thy hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%5%%And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down to Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%6%%And the Egyptians ill-treated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%7%%And when we cried to the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labor, and our oppression:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%8%%And the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%9%%And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%10%%And now, behold, I have brought the first-fruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me: and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%11%%And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%12%%When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thy increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%13%%Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%14%%I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I taken away aught of it for any unclean use, nor given aught of it for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%15%%Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%16%%This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to perform these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%17%%Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken to his voice:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%18%%And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldst keep all his commandments;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%26%%19%%And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people to the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%1%%And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%2%%And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%3%%And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou hast passed over, that thou mayest enter in to the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%4%%Therefore it shall be when ye have gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%5%%And there shalt thou build an altar to the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%6%%Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer on it burnt-offerings to the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%7%%And thou shalt offer peace-offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%8%%And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law, very plainly.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%9%%And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed and hearken, O Israel, this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%10%%Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%11%%And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%12%%These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye have come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%13%%And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%14%%And the Levites shall speak, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%15%%Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the artificer, and putteth it in a secret place: and all the people shall answer, and say Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%16%%Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%17%%Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%18%%Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%19%%Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%20%%Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%21%%Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%22%%Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%23%%Cursed be he that lieth with his mother-in-law: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%24%%Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%25%%Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%27%%26%%Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them: and all the people shall say, Amen.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%1%%And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently to the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day; that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%2%%And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%3%%Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%4%%Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy cattle, and the flocks of thy sheep.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%5%%Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%6%%Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%7%%The LORD shall cause thy enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%8%%The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store-houses, and in all that thou settest thy hand to: and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%9%%The LORD shall establish thee a holy people to himself, as he hath sworn to thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%10%%And all the people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%11%%And the LORD shall make thee to abound in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD swore to thy fathers to give thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%12%%The LORD shall open to thee his good treasure, the heaven to give rain to thy land in its season, and to bless all the work of thy hand: and thou shalt lend to many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%13%%And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if thou shalt hearken to the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%14%%And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%15%%But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%16%%Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%17%%Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%18%%Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%19%%Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%20%%The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou undertakest to perform, until thou shalt be destroyed, and until thou shalt perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings by which thou hast forsaken me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%21%%The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave to thee, until he shall have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%22%%The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew: and they shall pursue thee until thou dost perish.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%23%%And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%24%%The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou art destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%25%%The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thy enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them; and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%26%%And thy carcass shall be food to all fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and no man shall drive them away.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%27%%The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, of which thou canst not be healed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%28%%The LORD shall smite thee with the madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%29%%And thou shalt grope at noon-day, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%30%%Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell in it: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes of it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%31%%Thy ox shall be slain before thy eyes, and thou shalt not eat of it: thy ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given to thy enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%32%%Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given to another people, and thy eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thy hand.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%33%%The fruit of thy land, and all thy labors, shall be eaten by a nation which thou knowest not: and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%34%%So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thy eyes which thou shalt see.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%35%%The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot to the top of thy head.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%36%%The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, to a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%37%%And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a by-word, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%38%%Thou shalt carry much seed into the field, and shalt gather but little: for the locust shall consume it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%39%%Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the worm shall eat them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%40%%Thou shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil: for thy olive shall cast its fruit.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%41%%Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them: for they shall go into captivity.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%42%%All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%43%%The stranger that is within thee shall rise above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%44%%He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%45%%Moreover, all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou art destroyed: because thou hearkenedst not to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%46%%And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%47%%Because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%48%%Therefore shalt thou serve thy enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he hath destroyed thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%49%%The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth, a nation whose language thou shalt not understand:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%50%%A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%51%%And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou art destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy cattle, or flocks of thy sheep, until he hath destroyed thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%52%%And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fortified walls come down, in which thou didst trust, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the LORD thy God hath given thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%53%%And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege and in the straitness with which thy enemies shall distress thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%54%%So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil towards his brother, and towards the wife of his bosom, and towards the remnant of his children whom he shall leave:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%55%%So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness with which thy enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%56%%The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil towards the husband of her bosom, and towards her son, and towards her daughter,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%57%%And towards her young one, her own offspring, and towards her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness with which thy enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%58%%If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%59%%Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%60%%Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid; and they shall cleave to thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%61%%Also every sickness, and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou art destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%62%%And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldst not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%63%%And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to naught; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%64%%And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%65%%And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%66%%And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have no assurance of thy life:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%67%%In the morning thou shalt say, O that it were evening, and at evening thou shalt say, O that it were morning! for the fear of thy heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thy eyes which thou shalt see.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%28%%68%%And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I have said to thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold to your enemies for bond-men and bond-women, and no man shall buy you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%1%%These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%2%%And Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%3%%The great temptations which thy eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%4%%Yet the LORD hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%5%%And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not become old upon you, and thy shoe hath not become old upon thy foot.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%6%%Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drank wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%7%%And when ye came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we smote them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%8%%And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%9%%Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%10%%Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%11%%Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy water:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%12%%That thou shouldst enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%13%%That he may establish thee to-day for a people to himself, and that he may be to thee a God, as he hath said to thee, and as he hath sworn to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%14%%Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%15%%But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%16%%(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%17%%And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%18%%Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%19%%And it should come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he should bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%20%%The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%21%%And the LORD shall separate him to evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%22%%So that the generation to come of your children that shall arise after you, and the stranger that shall come from a distant land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%23%%And that the whole land of it is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor doth it bear, nor doth any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%24%%Even all the nations shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%25%%Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth from the land of Egypt:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%26%%For they went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods which they knew not, and which he had not given to them:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%27%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%28%%And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%29%%29%%The secret things belong to the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong to us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%1%%And it shall come to pass, when all these things have come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%2%%And shalt return to the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%3%%That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%4%%If any of thine shall be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he bring thee:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%5%%And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it: and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%6%%And the LORD thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%7%%And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thy enemies, and on them that hate thee, who persecuted thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%8%%And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%9%%And the LORD thy God will make thee to abound in every work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%10%%If thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou shalt turn to the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%11%%For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hid from thee, neither is it far off.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%12%%It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say, Who shall ascend for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%13%%Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldst say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%14%%But the word is very nigh to thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%15%%See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%16%%In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%17%%But if thy heart shall turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%18%%I denounce to you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%19%%I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%30%%20%%That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days) that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swore to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%1%%And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%2%%And he said to them, I am a hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said to me, thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%3%%The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%4%%And the LORD shall do to them as he did to Sihon, and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to the land of them, whom he destroyed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%5%%And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%6%%Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee, he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%7%%And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people to the land which the LORD hath sworn to their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%8%%And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%9%%And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%10%%And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%11%%When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%12%%Convene the people, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%13%%And that their children who have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%14%%And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%15%%And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud; and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%16%%And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up, and commit idolatry with the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%17%%Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them, so that they will say in that day, Have not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%18%%And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%19%%Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%20%%For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%21%%And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles have befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness: for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they form, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%22%%Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%23%%And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%24%%And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%25%%That Moses commanded the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%26%%Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%27%%For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%28%%Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%29%%For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%31%%30%%And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%1%%Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%2%%My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%3%%Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness to our God.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%4%%He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity: just and right is he.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%5%%They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%6%%Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%7%%Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%8%%When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%9%%For the LORD'S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%10%%He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%11%%As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%12%%So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with him.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%13%%He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%14%%Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%15%%But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou hast waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%16%%They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations they provoked him to anger.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%17%%They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods which they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%18%%Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%19%%And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%20%%And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%21%%They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%22%%For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%23%%I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%24%%They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%25%%The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%26%%I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%27%%Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%28%%For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%29%%O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%30%%How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%31%%For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%32%%For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%33%%Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%34%%Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%35%%To me belongeth vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%36%%For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent for his servants: when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%37%%And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%38%%Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%39%%See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%40%%For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%41%%If I shall whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%42%%I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%43%%Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%44%%And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%45%%And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%46%%And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%47%%For it is not a vain thing for you: because it is your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%48%%And the LORD spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%49%%Ascend this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan which I give to the children of Israel for a Possession:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%50%%And die in the mount whither thou goest, and be gathered to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%51%%Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%32%%52%%Yet thou shalt see the land before thee, but thou shalt not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%1%%And this is the with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%2%%And he said, the LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%3%%Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%4%%Moses commanded us a law; even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%5%%And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were assembled.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%6%%Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%7%%And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him to his people: let his hands be sufficient for him, and be thou a help to him from his enemies.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%8%%And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%9%%Who said to his father and to his mother, I have not seen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%10%%They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thy altar.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%11%%Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%12%%And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the LORD shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%13%%And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%14%%And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%15%%And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%16%%And for the precious things of the earth and fullness of it, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush; let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%17%%His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%18%%And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and Issachar, in thy tents.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%19%%They shall call the people to the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%20%%And of Gad he said: Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%21%%And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated: and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%22%%And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%23%%And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%24%%And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%25%%Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%26%%There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellence on the sky.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%27%%The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%28%%Israel then shall dwell in safety alone; the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine, also his heavens shall drop down dew.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%33%%29%%Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like to thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellence! and thy enemies shall be found liars to thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%1%%And Moses went up from the plains of Moab, upon the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho: and the LORD showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%2%%And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the utmost sea,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%3%%And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Zoar.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%4%%And the LORD said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thy eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%5%%So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%6%%And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulcher to this day.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%7%%And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%8%%And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%9%%And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened to him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%10%%And there arose not a prophet afterwards in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%11%%In all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
1000005%%Deuteronomy%%OT%%34%%12%%And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%1%%Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, it came to pass, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%2%%Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%3%%Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said to Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%4%%From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea towards the setting of the sun, shall be your border.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%5%%There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%6%%Be strong and of a good courage: for to this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%7%%Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%8%%This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate in it day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%9%%Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%10%%Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%11%%Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you provisions; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%12%%And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%13%%Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%14%%Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and help them;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%15%%Until the LORD shall have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side of Jordan towards the sun-rising.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%16%%And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us, we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%17%%According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%1%%18%%Every one that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken to thy words in all that thou commandest him, shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%1%%And Joshua the son of Nun sent from Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go, view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into the house of a harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%2%%And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to-night of the children of Israel, to search out the country.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%3%%And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come to thee, who have entered into thy house: for they have come to search out all the country.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%4%%And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men to me, but I knew not whence they were:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%5%%And it came to pass about the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went, I know not: pursue after them quickly; for ye will overtake them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%6%%But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%7%%And the men pursued them the way to Jordan to the fords: and as soon as they who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%8%%And before they had lain down, she came up to them upon the roof;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%9%%And she said to the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%10%%For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%11%%And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%12%%Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%13%%And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%14%%And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%15%%Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town-wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%16%%And she said to them, Depart to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned: and afterward ye may go your way.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%17%%And the men said to her, We will be blameless of this thy oath which thou hast made us swear.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%18%%Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which thou didst let us down: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household home to thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%19%%And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%20%%And if thou shalt utter this our business, then we will be quit of thy oath which thou hast made us to swear.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%21%%And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%22%%And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%23%%So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%2%%24%%And they said to Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%1%%And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%2%%And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%3%%And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%4%%Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%5%%And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to-morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%6%%And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%7%%And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%8%%And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%9%%And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%10%%And Joshua said, By this ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%11%%Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%12%%Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%13%%And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand in a heap.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%14%%And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%15%%And as they that bore the ark had come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all its banks all the time of harvest,)
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%16%%That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down towards the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%3%%17%%And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people had passed quite over Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%1%%And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%2%%Take you twelve men from the people, from every tribe a man,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%3%%And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, from the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%4%%Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, of every tribe a man:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%5%%And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%6%%That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%7%%Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of Israel for ever.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%8%%And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the midst of Jordan, as the the LORD commanded Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%9%%And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%10%%For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%11%%And it came to pass, when all the people had quite passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests in the presence of the people.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%12%%And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses directed them:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%13%%About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%14%%On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%15%%And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%16%%Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%17%%Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%18%%And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up upon the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks, as they did before.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%19%%And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%20%%And those twelve stones which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%21%%And he spoke to the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%22%%Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%23%%For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye had passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had gone over:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%4%%24%%That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%1%%And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we had passed over, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%2%%At that time the LORD said to Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%3%%And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%4%%And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%5%%Now all the people that came out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth from Egypt, them they had not circumcised.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%6%%For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war who came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: to whom the LORD swore that he would not show them the land which the LORD swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%7%%And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%8%%And it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%9%%And the LORD said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%10%%And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%11%%And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the same day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%12%%And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%13%%And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%14%%And he said, No; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What saith my lord to his servant?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%5%%15%%And the captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou standest is holy: and Joshua did so.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%1%%Now Jericho was closely shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%2%%And the LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given into thy hand Jericho, and its king, and the mighty men of valor.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%3%%And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round the city once: thus shalt thou do six days.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%4%%And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%5%%And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend every man straight before him.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%6%%And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%7%%And he said to the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%8%%And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%9%%And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rear-guard came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%10%%And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed from your mouth, until the day I bid you shout, then shall ye shout.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%11%%So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%12%%And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%13%%And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rear-guard came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%14%%And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%15%%And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%16%%And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%17%%And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are in it, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%18%%And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%19%%But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated to the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%20%%So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%21%%And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%22%%But Joshua had said to the two men that spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye swore to her.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%23%%And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%24%%And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%25%%And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even to this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%26%%And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay its foundation in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%6%%27%%So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%1%%But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%2%%And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%3%%And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labor thither; for they are but few.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%4%%So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%5%%And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even to Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%6%%And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%7%%And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? O that we had been content, and dwelt on the other side of Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%8%%O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turn their backs before their enemies!
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%9%%For the Canaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will environ us, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%10%%And the LORD said to Joshua, Arise; Why liest thou thus upon thy face?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%11%%Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own goods.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%12%%Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%13%%Rise, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thy enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%14%%In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to their families: and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%15%%And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%16%%So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%17%%And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%18%%And he brought his household man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%19%%And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%20%%And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%21%%When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them, and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%22%%So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%23%%And they took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%24%%And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%25%%And Joshua said, why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%7%%26%%And they raised over him a great heap of stones to this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger: wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of Achor to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%1%%And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%2%%And thou shalt do to Ai and her king, as thou didst to Jericho and her king: only its spoil, and its cattle, shall ye take for a prey to yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%3%%So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them away by night.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%4%%And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%5%%And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach to the city: and it shall come to pass when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%6%%(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%7%%Then ye shall rise from the ambush and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%8%%And it shall be when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%9%%Joshua therefore sent them forth; and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%10%%And Joshua rose early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%11%%And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%12%%And he took about five thousand men; and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%13%%And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%14%%And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain: but he knew not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%15%%And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%16%%And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue them: and they pursued Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%17%%And there was not a man left in Ai, or Beth-el that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%18%%And the LORD said to Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand towards Ai; for I will give it into thy hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand towards the city.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%19%%And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted, and set the city on fire.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%20%%And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%21%%And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%22%%And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%23%%And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%24%%And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they had all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%25%%And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%26%%For Joshua drew not his hand back with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%27%%Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%28%%And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap for ever, even a desolation to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%29%%And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until evening: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise upon it a great heap of stones, that remaineth to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%30%%Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%31%%As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lifted up any iron: and they offered upon it burnt-offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace-offerings.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%32%%And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%33%%And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark, and on that side, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%34%%And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%8%%35%%There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%1%%And it came to pass, when all the kings who were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite heard these things,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%2%%That they assembled themselves, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%3%%And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%4%%They did work craftily, and went and made as if they had been embassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%5%%And old shoes and patched upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and moldy.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%6%%And they went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him, and to the men of Israel, We have come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%7%%And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, It may be ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%8%%And they said to Joshua, we are thy servants. And Joshua said to them, Who are ye? and whence come ye?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%9%%And they said to him, From a very far country thy servants have come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%10%%And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%11%%Wherefore our elders, and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provisions with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%12%%This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is moldy:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%13%%And these bottles of wine which we filled, were new, and behold, they are rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%14%%And the men took of their provisions, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%15%%And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%16%%And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%17%%And the children of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%18%%And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%19%%But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%20%%This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%21%%And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood, and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%22%%And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have ye deceived us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%23%%Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%24%%And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were greatly afraid for our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%25%%And now, behold, we are in thy hand: do as it seemeth good and right to thee to do to us,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%26%%And so did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%9%%27%%And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even to this day, in the place which he should choose.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%1%%Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%2%%That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men of it were mighty.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%3%%Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%4%%Come up to me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%5%%Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, assembled themselves, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%6%%And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains, are assembled against us.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%7%%So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%8%%And the LORD said to Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%9%%Joshua therefore came to them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%10%%And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and to Makkedah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%11%%And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel, and were in the descent to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them to Azekah, and they died: they were more who died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%12%%Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%13%%And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%14%%And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%15%%And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp at Gilgal.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%16%%But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%17%%And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%18%%And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%19%%And stay you not, but pursue your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%20%%And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest who remained of them entered into fortified cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%21%%And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%22%%Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of the cave.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%23%%And they did so, and brought those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%24%%And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%25%%And Joshua said to them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%26%%And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%27%%And it came to pass at the time of the setting of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and laid great stones upon the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%28%%And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king of it he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%29%%Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%30%%And the LORD delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it; he let none remain in it; but did to the king of it as he did to the king of Jericho.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%31%%And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%32%%And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, who took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%33%%Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%34%%And from Lachish Joshua passed to Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%35%%And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%36%%And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%37%%And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining (according to all that he had done to Eglon) but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were in it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%38%%And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%39%%And he took it, and its king, and all its cities, and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in them; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%40%%So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%41%%And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%42%%And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time; because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%10%%43%%And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp in Gilgal.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%1%%And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king Achshaph,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%2%%And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Cinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%3%%And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%4%%And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people, even as the sand that is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very numerous.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%5%%And when all these kings were met together, they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%6%%And the LORD said to Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to-morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%7%%So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly, and they fell upon them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%8%%And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephoth-maim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left to them none remaining.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%9%%And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%10%%And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote its king with the sword: for Hazor before-time was the head of all those kingdoms.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%11%%And they smote all the souls that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%12%%And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, Joshua took, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%13%%But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%14%%And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey to themselves: but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%15%%As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua: he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%16%%So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%17%%Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even to Baal-gad, in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%18%%Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%19%%There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%20%%For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%21%%And at that time came Joshua and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%22%%There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%11%%23%%So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%1%%Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side of Jordan towards the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon, to mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%2%%Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%3%%And from the plain to the sea of Cinneroth on the east, and to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%4%%And the coast of Og king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%5%%And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%6%%Them did Moses the servant of the LORD, and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%7%%And these are the kings of the country whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side of Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon, even to the mount Halak that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%8%%In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%9%%The king of Jericho one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%10%%The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%13%%The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%14%%The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%15%%The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%16%%The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%17%%The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%18%%The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%19%%The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%20%%The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%21%%The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%22%%The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%12%%24%%The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%1%%Now Joshua was old and advanced in years; and the LORD said to him Thou art old and advanced in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%2%%This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%3%%From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%4%%From the south all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, to Aphek to the borders of the Amorites:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%5%%And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon towards the sun-rising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%6%%And the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%7%%Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%8%%With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%9%%From Aroer that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%12%%All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants. For these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%13%%Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%14%%Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said to them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%15%%And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%16%%And their border was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%22%%Balaam also the son of Beor, the sooth-sayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slain by them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%23%%And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and its border. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%24%%And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%25%%And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%26%%And from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%27%%And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and its border, even to the edge of the sea of Cinneroth, on the other side of Jordan eastward.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%28%%This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%29%%And Moses gave inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%30%%And their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%31%%And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%32%%These are the countries which Moses distributed for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%13%%33%%But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said to them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%1%%And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%2%%By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%3%%For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half-tribe on the other side of Jordan: but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%4%%For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle, and for their substance.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%5%%As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%6%%Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%7%%Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%8%%Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%9%%And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which thy feet have trodden shall be thy inheritance, and thy children's for ever; because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%10%%And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day eighty five years old.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%11%%As yet I am as strong this day, as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%12%%Now therefore give me this mountain, of which the LORD spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fortified: if the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%13%%And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%14%%Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%14%%15%%And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%1%%This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south border.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%2%%And their south border was from the shore of the salt-sea, from the bay that looketh southward:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%3%%And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended on the south side to Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%4%%From thence it passed towards Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the limits of that border were at the sea: this shall be your south limit.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%5%%And the east border was the salt-sea, even to the end of Jordan: and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea, at the uttermost part of Jordan:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%6%%And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%7%%And the border went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed towards the waters of En-shemesh, and the borders of it were at En-rogel:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%8%%And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%9%%And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%10%%And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim (which is Chesalon) on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%11%%And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the terminations of the border were at the sea.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%12%%And the west border was to the great sea, and its coast: this is the border of the children of Judah round about, according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%13%%And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%14%%And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%15%%And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%16%%And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%17%%And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%18%%And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wouldst thou?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%19%%Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%20%%This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%21%%And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah towards the border of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%22%%And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%15%%63%%As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not expel them: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%1%%And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Beth-el,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%2%%And goeth out from Beth-el to Luz, and passeth along to the borders of Archi to Ataroth,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%3%%And goeth down westward to the border of Japhleti, to the border of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the limits of it are at the sea.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%4%%So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%5%%And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-adar, to Beth-horon the upper:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%6%%And the border went out towards the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward to Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%7%%And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and terminated at Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%8%%The border went out from Tappuah westward to the river Kanah; and the limits of it were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%9%%And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%16%%10%%And they did not expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and serve under tribute.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%1%%There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the first-born of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the first-born of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%2%%There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%3%%But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%4%%And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren: therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%5%%And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of Jordan;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%6%%Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%7%%And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand to the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%8%%Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%9%%And the border descended to the river Kanah, southward of the river. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the border of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the limits of it were at the sea:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%10%%Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%11%%And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Tanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, even three countries.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%12%%Yet the children of Manasseh could not expel the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%13%%Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel had become strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly expel them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%14%%And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath hitherto blessed me?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%15%%And Joshua answered them, If thou art a great people, then go up to the wood, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%16%%And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and its towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%17%%And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%17%%18%%But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the limits of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they are strong.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%1%%And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there: and the land was subdued before them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%2%%And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%3%%And Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%4%%Select from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them, and they shall come again to me.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%5%%And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%6%%Ye shall therefore describe the land in seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%7%%But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%8%%And the men arose, and departed: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go, and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%9%%And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven parts in a book, and came again, to Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%10%%And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%11%%And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%12%%And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the limits of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%13%%And the border went over from thence towards Luz, to the side of Luz (which is Beth-el) southward; and the border descended to Ataroth-adar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Beth-horon.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%14%%And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the limits of it were at Kirjath-baal (which is Kirjath-jearim) a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%15%%And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjah-jearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%16%%And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%17%%And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh, and went forth towards Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%18%%And passed along towards the side over against Arabah northward, and went down to Arabah:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%19%%And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward: and the limits of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan. This was the south border.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%20%%And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the limits of it round about, according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%21%%Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin, according to their families, were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%22%%And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%23%%And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%24%%And Chephar-haamonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%25%%Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%26%%And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%18%%28%%And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, (which is Jerusalem) Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%1%%And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%2%%And they had in their inheritance, Beer-sheba, and Sheba, and Moladah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%3%%And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%4%%And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%5%%And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%6%%And Beth-lebaoth, and Sheruhen; thirteen cities and their villages:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%7%%Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%8%%And all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%9%%Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%10%%And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was to Sarid:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%11%%And their border went up towards the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%12%%And turned from Sarid eastward, towards the sun-rising, to the border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%13%%And from thence passeth along on the east to Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to Neah;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%14%%And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the limits of it are in the valley of Jiphthah-el:

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%16%%This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%17%%And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%18%%And their border was towards Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%22%%And the border reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Beth-shemesh, and the limits of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%23%%This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%24%%And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%28%%And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Zidon;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%29%%And then the border turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the border turneth to Hosah: and the limits of it are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%30%%Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%31%%This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%32%%The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%33%%And their border was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakum; and the limits thereof were at Jordan:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%34%%And then the border turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan towards the sun-rising.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%35%%And the fortified cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%40%%And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%41%%And the border of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Ir-shemesh,

1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%47%%And the border of the children of Dan, went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%48%%This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%49%%When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their borders, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%50%%According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%19%%51%%These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%1%%The LORD also spoke to Joshua, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%2%%Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint for you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by the hand of Moses:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%3%%That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and ignorantly, may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%4%%And when he that doth flee to one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city to them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%5%%And if the avenger of blood shall pursue him, then they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand; because he smote his neighbor ignorantly, and had not hated him before.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%6%%And he shall dwell in that city, until he shall stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high-priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city from whence he fled.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%7%%And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjath-arba, (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%8%%And on the other side of Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%20%%9%%These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever should kill any person unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%1%%Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%2%%And they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for our cattle.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%3%%And the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%4%%And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%5%%And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%6%%And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%7%%The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%8%%And the children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%9%%And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%10%%Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%11%%And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak (which city is Hebron) in the hill-country of Judah, with its suburbs round it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%12%%But the fields of the city, and its villages, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%13%%Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest, Hebron with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%14%%And Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%15%%And Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%16%%And Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs, and Beth-shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%17%%And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%18%%Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%19%%All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%20%%And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites who remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%21%%For they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%22%%And Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth-horon with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%23%%And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%24%%Ajalon with its suburbs, Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%25%%And out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%26%%All the cities were ten with their suburbs, for the families of the children of Kohath that remained.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%27%%And to the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half-tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer, and Beesh-terah with its suburbs; two cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%28%%And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with its suburbs, Dabareh with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%29%%Jarmuth with its suburbs, En-gannim with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%30%%And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%31%%Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%32%%And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor with its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%33%%All the cities of the Gershonites, according to their families, were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%34%%And to the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs, and Kartah with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%35%%Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%36%%And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahazah with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%37%%Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs; four cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%38%%And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%39%%Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%40%%So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%41%%All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%42%%These cities were every one with their suburbs around them. Thus were all these cities.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%43%%And the LORD gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers: and they possessed it, and dwelt in it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%44%%And the LORD gave them rest on all sides, according to all that he swore to their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%21%%45%%There failed not aught of any good thing which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%1%%Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%2%%And said to them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%3%%Ye have not left your brethren these many days to this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%4%%And now the LORD your God hath given rest to your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and go to your tents, and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of Jordan.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%5%%But take diligent heed to perform the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%6%%So Joshua blessed them and sent them away; and they went to their tents.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%7%%Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given possession in Bashan: but to the other half of it gave Joshua among their brethren on this side of Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also to their tents, then he blessed them,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%8%%And he spoke to them, saying, Return with much riches to your tents, and with very many cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%9%%And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%10%%And when they came to the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to the sight.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%11%%And the children of Israel heard it said, Behold, the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%12%%And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%13%%And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%14%%And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was a head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%15%%And they came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%16%%Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have built you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%17%%Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%18%%But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to-day against the LORD, that to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%19%%Not withstanding, if the land of your possession is unclean, then pass ye over to the land of the possession of the LORD, in which the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of the LORD our God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%20%%Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%21%%Then the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%22%%The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it is in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%23%%That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer on it burnt-offering, or meat-offering, or if to offer peace-offerings on it, let the LORD himself require it;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%24%%And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children may speak to our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%25%%For the LORD hath made Jordan a boundary between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD. So shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%26%%Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%27%%But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we may do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%28%%Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they shall so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%29%%Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt-offerings, for meat-offerings, or for sacrifices, besides the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%30%%And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%31%%And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%32%%And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, from the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%33%%And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%22%%34%%And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%1%%And it came to pass, a long time after that the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies on all sides, that Joshua became old and advanced in age.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%2%%And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said to them, I am old and advanced in age:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%3%%And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%4%%Behold, I have divided to you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea westward.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%5%%And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised to you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%6%%Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside from it to the right hand or to the left;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%7%%That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves to them:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%8%%But cleave to the LORD your God, as ye have done to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%9%%For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you to this day.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%10%%One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%11%%Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%12%%Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave to the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and associate with them, and they with you:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%13%%Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps to you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%14%%And behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth; and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spoke concerning you: all are come to pass to you, and not one thing hath failed of it.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%15%%Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%23%%16%%When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given to you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%1%%And Joshua convened all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%2%%And Joshua said to all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor: and they served other gods.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%3%%And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%4%%And I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%5%%I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%6%%And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red sea.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%7%%And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%8%%And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of Jordan, and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%9%%Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%10%%But I would not hearken to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%11%%And ye went over Jordan, and came to Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%12%%And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%13%%And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and olive-yards which ye planted not do ye eat.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%14%%Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%15%%And if it seemeth evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%16%%And the people answered, and said, Be it far from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%17%%For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us, and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way in which we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%18%%And the LORD drove out from before us all the people, even the Amorites who dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%19%%And Joshua said to the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%20%%If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%21%%And the people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%22%%And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%23%%Now therefore put away (said he) the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%24%%And the people said to Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%25%%So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%26%%And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%27%%And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness to us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spoke to us, it shall be therefore a witness to you, lest ye deny your God.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%28%%So Joshua let the people depart, every man to his inheritance.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%29%%And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the LORD died, being a hundred and ten years old.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%30%%And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%31%%And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and who had known all the works of the LORD that he had done for Israel.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%32%%And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
1000005%%Joshua%%OT%%24%%33%%And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%1%%Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%2%%And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%3%%And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%4%%And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%5%%And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%6%%But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%7%%And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%8%%(Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%9%%And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%10%%And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%11%%And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%12%%And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%13%%And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%14%%And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wilt thou?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%15%%And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%16%%And the children of the Kenite, Moses's father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%17%%And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%18%%Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Askelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%19%%And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%20%%And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%21%%And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%22%%And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%23%%And the house of Joseph sent to explore Beth-el. Now the name of the city before was Luz.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%24%%And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%25%%And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword: but they let go the man and all his family.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%26%%And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz: which is its name to this day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%27%%Neither did Manasseh expel the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%28%%And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%29%%Neither did Ephraim expel the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%30%%Neither did Zebulun expel the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%31%%Neither did Asher expel the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%32%%But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not expel them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%33%%Neither did Naphtali expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%34%%And the Amorites forced the children of Dan to the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%35%%But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Ajalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%1%%36%%And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%1%%And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to depart from Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%2%%And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%3%%Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%4%%And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%5%%And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there to the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%6%%And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%7%%And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%8%%And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%9%%And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%10%%And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%11%%And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%12%%And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were around them, and bowed themselves to them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%13%%And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%14%%And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies around, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%15%%Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn to them: and they were greatly distressed.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%16%%Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, who delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%17%%And yet they would not hearken to their judges, but they went astray after other gods, and bowed themselves to them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%18%%And when the LORD raised up judges for them, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: (for the LORD repented because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and burdened them.)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%19%%And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%20%%And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%21%%I also will not henceforth drive out from before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%22%%That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%2%%23%%Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out speedily, neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%1%%Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, (even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%2%%Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it;)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%3%%Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt on mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%4%%And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%5%%And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%6%%And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%7%%And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim, and the groves.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%8%%Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%9%%And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%10%%And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%11%%And the land had rest forty years: and Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%12%%And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%13%%And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm-trees.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%14%%So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%15%%But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, a man left-handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon king of Moab.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%16%%But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%17%%And he brought the present to Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%18%%And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bore the present.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%19%%But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%20%%And Ehud came to him; and he was sitting in a summer-parlor, which he had for himself alone: and Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose from his seat.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%21%%And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%22%%And the haft also entered after the blade: and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%23%%Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlor upon him, and locked them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%24%%When he had gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlor were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer-chamber.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%25%%And they tarried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doors of the parlor, therefore they took a key and opened them: and behold, their lord lay dead on the earth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%26%%And Ehud escaped while they tarried; and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirath.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%27%%And it came to pass when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%28%%And he said to them, Follow me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%29%%And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valor: and there escaped not a man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%30%%So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel: and the land had rest eighty years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%3%%31%%And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox-goad; and he also delivered Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%1%%And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud was dead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%2%%And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan that reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose host was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%3%%And the children of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%4%%And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%5%%And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%6%%And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go, and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%7%%And I will draw to thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thy hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%8%%And Barak said to her, if thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%9%%And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thy honor; for the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%10%%And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%11%%Now Heber the Kenite, who was of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent to the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%12%%And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%13%%And Sisera collected all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the river of Kishon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%14%%And Deborah said to Barak, Arise, for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thy hand: hath not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%15%%And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%16%%But Barak pursued the chariots, and the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%17%%Howbeit, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%18%%And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in to her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%19%%And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%20%%Again he said to her, stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%21%%Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep, and weary. So he died.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%22%%And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%23%%So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%4%%24%%And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%1%%Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%2%%Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%3%%Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing to the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%4%%LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%5%%The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%6%%In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through by-ways.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%7%%The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%8%%They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%9%%My heart is towards the governors of Israel that offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%10%%Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%11%%They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts towards the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%12%%Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%13%%Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%14%%Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%15%%And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah: even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%16%%Why abodest thou among the sheep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%17%%Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea-shore, and abode in his breaches.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%18%%Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives to death in the high places of the field.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%19%%The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Tanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%20%%They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%21%%The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%22%%Then were the horse's hoofs broken by the means of the prancings, the prancings of their mighty ones.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%23%%Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly its inhabitants; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%24%%Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%25%%He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%26%%She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and struck through his temples.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%27%%At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%28%%The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%29%%Her wise ladies answered her, yes, she returned answer to herself.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%30%%Have they not found; have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colors, a prey of divers colors of needle-work, of divers colors of needle-work on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%5%%31%%So let all thy enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%1%%And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%2%%And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%3%%And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%4%%And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou comest to Gaza; and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%5%%For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%6%%And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%7%%And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%8%%That the LORD sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth from the house of bondage;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%9%%And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%10%%And I said to you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%11%%And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abi-ezrite: and his son Gideon thrashed wheat by the wine-press, to hide it from the Midianites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%12%%And the angel of the LORD appeared to him, and said to him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%13%%And Gideon said to him, O my Lord, if the LORD is with us, why then hath all this befallen us? and where are all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%14%%And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%15%%And he said to him, O my Lord, by what means shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%16%%And the LORD said to him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%17%%And he said to him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%18%%Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou comest again.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%19%%And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak, and presented it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%20%%And the angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%21%%Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed from his sight.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%22%%And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%23%%And the LORD said to him, Peace be to thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%24%%Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: to this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%25%%And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%26%%And build an altar to the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%27%%Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said to him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%28%%And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%29%%And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%30%%Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%31%%And Joash said to all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he is a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%32%%Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%33%%Then all the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east were assembled, and went over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%34%%But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was called after him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%35%%And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was called after him: and he sent messengers to Asher, and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%36%%And Gideon said to God, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%37%%Behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the floor; and if the dew shall be on the fleece only, and it shall be dry upon all the earth besides, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%38%%And it was so: for he rose early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl-full of water.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%39%%And Gideon said to God, Let not thy anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: Let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%6%%40%%And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%1%%Then Jerubbaal (who is Gideon) and all the people that were with him, rose early, and encamped beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%2%%And the LORD said to Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand hath saved me.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%3%%Now therefore, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%4%%And the LORD said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say to thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%5%%So he brought down the people to the water: and the LORD said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%6%%And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%7%%And the LORD said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand: and let all the other people go every man to his place.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%8%%So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent of all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. And the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%9%%And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said to him, Arise, go down to the host; for I have delivered it into thy hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%10%%But if thou fearest to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%11%%And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thy hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%12%%And the Midianites, and the Amalekites, and all the children of the east, lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%13%%And when Gideon had come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread rolled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it that the tent lay along.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%14%%And his fellow answered, and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%15%%And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and its interpretation, that he worshiped, and returned to the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%16%%And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%17%%And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that as I do, so shall ye do.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%18%%When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%19%%So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%20%%And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow with: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%21%%And they stood every man in his place around the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%22%%And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zereroth, and to the border of Abel-meholah, to Tabbath.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%23%%And the men of Israel assembled out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%24%%And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim assembled, and took the waters to Beth-barah and Jordan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%7%%25%%And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine-press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of Jordan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%1%%And the men of Ephraim said to him, Why hast thou treated us thus, that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? and they chid with him sharply.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%2%%And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%3%%God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then, when he had said that, their anger towards him abated.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%4%%And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%5%%And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread to the people that follow me: for they are faint, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%6%%And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy army?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%7%%And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%8%%And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%9%%And he spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%10%%Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%11%%And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%12%%And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%13%%And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun had risen,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%14%%And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him: and he described to him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, even seventy seven men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%15%%And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye upbraided me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are weary?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%16%%And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%17%%And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%18%%Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%19%%And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%20%%And he said to Jether his first-born, Arise, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%21%%Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%22%%Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%23%%And Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%24%%And Gideon said to them, I would desire a request of you, that you would give me every man the ear-rings of his prey. (For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%25%%And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and cast into it every man the ear-rings of his prey.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%26%%And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested, was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; besides ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about their camels' necks.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%27%%And Gideon made of it an ephod, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither astray after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%28%%Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they raised their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%29%%And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%30%%And Gideon had seventy sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%31%%And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%32%%And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulcher of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%33%%And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went astray after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%34%%And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%8%%35%%Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%1%%And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%2%%Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are seventy persons, should reign over you, or that one should reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%3%%And his mother's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%4%%And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, who followed him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%5%%And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, upon one stone; notwithstanding, yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%6%%And all the men of Shechem assembled, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%7%%And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice and cried, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%8%%The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%9%%But the olive-tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%10%%And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%11%%But the fig-tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%12%%Then said the trees to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%13%%And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%14%%Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%15%%And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%16%%Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%17%%(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you from the hand of Midian:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%18%%And ye have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother:)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%19%%If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%20%%But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%21%%And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%22%%When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%23%%Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%24%%That the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem who aided him in the killing of his brethren.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%25%%And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%26%%And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%27%%And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%28%%And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him; is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%29%%And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thy army, and come out.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%30%%And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%31%%And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed, and his brethren, are come to Shechem; and behold, they fortify the city against thee.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%32%%Now therefore rise by night, thou, and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%33%%And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun hath risen, thou shalt rise early, and attack the city: and behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%34%%And Abimelech rose, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%35%%And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%36%%And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%37%%And Gaal spoke again, and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%38%%Then said Zebul to him, Where is now thy mouth, with which thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? are not these the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%39%%And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%40%%And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%41%%And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%42%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%43%%And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and behold, the people had come out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%44%%And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%45%%And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were in it, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%46%%And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%47%%And it was told to Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were assembled.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%48%%And Abimelech ascended mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%49%%And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them: so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%50%%Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%51%%But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it after them, and ascended to the top of the tower.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%52%%And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%53%%And a certain woman cast a piece of of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%54%%Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%55%%And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%56%%Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%9%%57%%And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%1%%And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%2%%And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%3%%And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%4%%And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%5%%And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%6%%And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%7%%And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%8%%And that year they harassed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side of Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%9%%Moreover, the children of Ammon passed over Jordan, to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was greatly distressed.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%10%%And the children of Israel cried to the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%11%%And the LORD said to the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%12%%The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%13%%Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%14%%Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%15%%And the children of Israel said to the LORD, We have sinned: do thou to us whatever seemeth good to thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%16%%And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%17%%Then the children of Ammon were assembled, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves, and encamped in Mizpeh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%10%%18%%And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%1%%Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%2%%And Gilead's wife bore him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said to him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%3%%Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%4%%And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%5%%And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah out of the land of Tob:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%6%%And they said to Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%7%%And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did ye not hate me, and expel me from my father's house; and why have ye come to me now when ye are in distress?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%8%%And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%9%%And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%10%%And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The LORD be a witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%11%%Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%12%%And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%13%%And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%14%%And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%15%%And said to him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%16%%But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness to the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%17%%Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken to it. And in like manner they sent to the king of Moab; but he would not consent. And Israel abode in Kadesh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%18%%Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%19%%And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%20%%But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%21%%And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%22%%And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to Jordan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%23%%So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou possess it?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%24%%Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%25%%And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%26%%While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that are along by the borders of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%27%%Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%28%%But, the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%29%%Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%30%%And Jephthah vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%31%%Then it shall be, that whatever cometh out of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it for a burnt-offering.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%32%%So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%33%%And he smote them from Aroer even till thou comest to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%34%%And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%35%%And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I cannot go back.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%36%%And she said to him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth to the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thy enemies, even of the children of Ammon.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%37%%And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%38%%And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%39%%And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%11%%40%%That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%1%%And the men of Ephraim assembled, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee; we will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%2%%And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%3%%And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: why then have ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%4%%Then Jephthah collected all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%5%%And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites who had escaped, said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, No;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%6%%Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan. And there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%7%%And Jephthah judged Israel six years: then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%8%%And after him Ibzan of Beth-lehem judged Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%9%%And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons: and he judged Israel seven years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%10%%Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Beth-lehem.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%11%%And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%12%%And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Ajalon in the country of Zebulun.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%13%%And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%14%%And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on seventy ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%12%%15%%And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%1%%And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%2%%And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%3%%And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%4%%Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%5%%For lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth: and he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%6%%Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither did he tell me his name:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%7%%But he said to me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from his birth to the day of his death.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%8%%Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God, whom thou didst send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%9%%And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%10%%And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man hath appeared to me, that came to me the other day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%11%%And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman? And he said, I am.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%12%%And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%13%%And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman, let her beware.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%14%%She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%15%%And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%16%%And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though thou shouldst detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%17%%And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass, we may do thee honor?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%18%%And the angel of the LORD said to him, why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%19%%So Manoah took a kid, with a meat-offering, and offered it upon a rock to the LORD; and the angel did wonderously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%20%%For it came to pass, when the flame ascended towards heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%21%%But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%22%%And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%23%%But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would, as at this time, have told us such things as these.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%24%%And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%13%%25%%And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%1%%And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%2%%And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me for a wife.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%3%%Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%4%%But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%5%%Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and behold, a young lion roared against him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%6%%And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%7%%And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%8%%And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcass of the lion.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%9%%And he took of it in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they ate: but he told them not that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%10%%So his father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%11%%And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%12%%And Samson said to them, I will now propose a riddle to you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%13%%But if ye cannot declare it to me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said to him, propose thy riddle, that we may hear it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%14%%And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%15%%And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take what we possess? is it not so?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%16%%And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast proposed a riddle to the children of my people, and hast not told it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor to my mother, and shall I tell it to thee?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%17%%And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she urged him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%18%%And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%19%%And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments to them who expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%14%%20%%But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%1%%But it came to pass after a while, in the time of wheat-harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%2%%And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%3%%And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%4%%And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire-brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a fire-brand in the midst between two tails.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%5%%And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%6%%Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%7%%And Samson said to them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%8%%And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter. And he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%9%%Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%10%%And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come to bind Samson, to do to him as he hath done to us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%11%%Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%12%%And they said to him, We have come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%13%%And they spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%14%%And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his the hands.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%15%%And he found a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men with it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%16%%And Samson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%17%%And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%18%%And he was very thirsty, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die by thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%19%%But God cleaved a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of it; and when he had drank, his spirit came again, and he revived. Wherefore he called the name of it En-hakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%15%%20%%And he judged Israel, in the days of the Philistines, twenty years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%1%%Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went in to her.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%2%%And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they encompassed him, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning when it is day we shall kill him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%3%%And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%4%%And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%5%%And the lords of the Philistines came to her, and said to her, Entice him, and see in what his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%6%%And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, in what thy great strength lieth, and with what thou mayest be bound to afflict thee.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%7%%And Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green withs, that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%8%%Then the lords of the Philistines brought to her seven green withs, which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%9%%(Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.) And she said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%10%%And Delilah said to Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, with what thou mayest be bound.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%11%%And he said to her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were used, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%12%%Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him with them, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. (And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.) And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%13%%And Delilah said to Samson, hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me with what thou mayest be bound. And he said to her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%14%%And she fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%15%%And she said to him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me in what thy great strength lieth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%16%%And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed to death;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%17%%That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There hath not come a razor upon my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my birth: if I be shaved, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%18%%And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath disclosed to me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought money in their hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%19%%And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%20%%And she said, the Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he knew not that the LORD had departed from him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%21%%But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%22%%However the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaved.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%23%%Then the lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%24%%And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country; who slew many of us.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%25%%And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%26%%And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars upon which the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%27%%Now the house was full of men and women: and all the lords of the Philistines were there: and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%28%%And Samson called to the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%29%%And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was supported, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%30%%And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%16%%31%%Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burying-place of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%1%%And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%2%%And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%3%%And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to thee.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%4%%Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%5%%And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%6%%In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%7%%And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%8%%And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%9%%And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%10%%And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%11%%And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%12%%And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%17%%13%%Then said Micah, Now I know that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%1%%In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought for themselves an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day all their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%2%%And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their borders, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to explore the land, and to search it; and they said to them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%3%%When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said to him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%4%%And he said to them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%5%%And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%6%%And the priest said to them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way in which ye go.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%7%%Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were in it, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%8%%And they came to their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said to them, What say ye?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%9%%And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%10%%When ye go, ye shall come to a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is on the earth.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%11%%And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%12%%And they went up, and encamped in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day: behold, it is behind Kirjath-jearim.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%13%%And they passed thence to mount Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%14%%Then answered the five men that went to explore the country of Laish, and said to their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%15%%And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and saluted him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%16%%And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%17%%And the five men that went to explore the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%18%%And these went into Micah's house, and brought the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest to them, What do ye?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%19%%And they said to him, Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: Is it better for thee to be a priest to the house of one man, or that thou shouldst be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%20%%And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%21%%So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, and the cattle, and the furniture before them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%22%%And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were collected, and overtook the children of Dan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%23%%And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%24%%And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye have gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say to me, What aileth thee?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%25%%And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows rush upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%26%%And the children of Dan departed: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%27%%And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%28%%And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built a city and dwelt in it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%29%%And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: but the name of the city was Laish at the first.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%30%%And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%18%%31%%And they set up for themselves Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%1%%And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite dwelling on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem-judah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%2%%And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there four whole months.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%3%%And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%4%%And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they ate and drank, and lodged there.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%5%%And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he arose to depart: and the damsel's father said to his son-in-law, Comfort thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward depart.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%6%%And they sat down, and ate and drank both of them together: for the damsel's father had said to the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thy heart be merry.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%7%%And when the man rose to depart, his father-in-law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%8%%And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thy heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they ate both of them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%9%%And when the man arose to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said to him, Behold now the day draweth towards evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day is coming to an end, lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%10%%But the man would not tarry that night, but he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%11%%And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in to this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%12%%And his master said to him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%13%%And he said to his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%14%%And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%15%%And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%16%%And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening, who was also of mount Ephraim; and he dwelt in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjaminites.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%17%%And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a way-faring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%18%%And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-Judah towards the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Beth-lehem-judah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me into his house.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%19%%Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%20%%And the old man said, Peace be with thee; however, let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%21%%So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet and ate and drank.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%22%%Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house on all sides, and beat at the door, and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%23%%And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this folly.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%24%%Behold, here is my daughter, a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%25%%But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%26%%Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%27%%And her lord rose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshhold.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%28%%And he said to her, Rise, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her upon an ass, and the man rose, and went to his place.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%29%%And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the borders of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%19%%30%%And it was so, that all that saw it, said, There hath been no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came from the land of Egypt to this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%1%%Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%2%%And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%3%%(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%4%%And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%5%%And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%6%%And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%7%%Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%8%%And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%9%%But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up by lot against it;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%10%%And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%11%%So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%12%%And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%13%%Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and banish evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel:
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%14%%But the children of Benjamin assembled out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%15%%And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%16%%Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed; every one could sling stones to a hair-breadth, and not miss.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%17%%And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%18%%And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%19%%And the children of Israel rose in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%20%%And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%21%%And the children of Benjamin came forth from Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%22%%And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%23%%(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%24%%And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%25%%And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%26%%Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%27%%And the children of Israel inquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%28%%And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver them into thy hand.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%29%%And Israel set liers in wait around Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%30%%And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%31%%And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%32%%And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city to the highways.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%33%%And all the men of Israel rose out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%34%%And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was severe: but they knew not that evil was near them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%35%%And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%36%%So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjaminites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%37%%And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%38%%Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke to rise from the city.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%39%%And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%40%%But when the flame began to rise from the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the flame of the city ascended to heaven.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%41%%And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil had come upon them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%42%%Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%43%%Thus they inclosed the Benjaminites on all sides, and chased them, and trod them down with ease over against Gibeah towards the sun-rising.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%44%%And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valor.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%45%%And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them to Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%46%%So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valor.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%47%%But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%20%%48%%And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%1%%Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%2%%And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept bitterly;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%3%%And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to-day one tribe lacking in Israel?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%4%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%5%%And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%6%%And the children of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%7%%How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD, that we will not give them of our daughters for wives?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%8%%And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? and behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%9%%For the people were numbered, and behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%10%%And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%11%%And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%12%%And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%13%%And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably to them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%14%%And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead: and yet so they sufficed them not.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%15%%And the people repented for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%16%%Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%17%%And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that have escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%18%%But, we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%19%%Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%20%%Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go, and lie in wait in the vineyards;
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%21%%And see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%22%%And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to us to complain, that we will say to them, Be favorable to them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give to them at this time, that ye should be guilty.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%23%%And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and repaired the cities and dwelt in them.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%24%%And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went from thence every man to his inheritance.
1000005%%Judges%%OT%%21%%25%%In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%1%%Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%2%%And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%3%%And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%4%%And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%5%%And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%6%%Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%7%%Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%8%%And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%9%%The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%10%%And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%11%%And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%12%%Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons;
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%13%%Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%14%%And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%15%%And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%16%%And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%17%%Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death shall part thee and me.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%18%%When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%19%%So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%20%%And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%21%%I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%1%%22%%So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%1%%And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%2%%And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%3%%And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her lot was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%4%%And behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said to the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%5%%Then said Boaz to his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%6%%And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi from the country of Moab:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%7%%And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%8%%Then said Boaz to Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%9%%Let thy eyes be on the field that they are reaping, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art thirsty go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%10%%Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found grace in thy eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%11%%And Boaz answered and said to her, It hath fully been shown to me, all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%12%%The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou hast come to trust.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%13%%Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I am not like to one of thy handmaidens.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%14%%And Boaz said to her, At meal-time come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%15%%And when she had risen to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%16%%And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%17%%So she gleaned in the field until evening, and beat out that which she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%18%%And she took it, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her what she had reserved after she was satisfied.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%19%%And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou labored? blessed be he that took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%20%%And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our next kinsmen.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%21%%And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said to me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%22%%And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou shouldst go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%2%%23%%So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean to the end of barley-harvest and of wheat-harvest; and dwelt with her mother-in-law.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%1%%Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%2%%And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%3%%Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor: but make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%4%%And it shall be when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%5%%And she said to her, All that thou sayest to me I will do.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%6%%And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%7%%And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%8%%And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%9%%And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%10%%And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor or rich.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%11%%And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%12%%And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%13%%Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%14%%And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%15%%Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%16%%And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%17%%And she said, These six measures of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%3%%18%%Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%1%%Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%2%%And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%3%%And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%4%%And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%5%%Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%6%%And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%7%%Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%8%%Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%9%%And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%10%%Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%11%%And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%12%%And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%13%%So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%14%%And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%15%%And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%16%%And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%17%%And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%18%%Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%19%%And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%20%%And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%21%%And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
1000005%%Ruth%%OT%%4%%22%%And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%1%%Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%2%%And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%3%%And this man went up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%4%%And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%5%%But to Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah; but the LORD had rendered her barren.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%6%%And her adversary also provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because the LORD had made her barren.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%7%%And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%8%%Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%9%%So Hannah rose after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%10%%And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%11%%And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give to thy handmaid a male child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%12%%And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli observed her mouth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%13%%Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%14%%And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%15%%And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%16%%Count not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%17%%Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%18%%And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%19%%And they rose in the morning early, and worshiped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%20%%Wherefore it came to pass, when the time had arrived, after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%21%%And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%22%%But Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%23%%And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seemeth to thee good; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and nursed her son until she weaned him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%24%%And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%25%%And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%26%%And she said, O my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%27%%For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%1%%28%%Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshiped the LORD there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%1%%And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%2%%There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%3%%Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%4%%The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%5%%They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children is become feeble.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%6%%The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%7%%The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%8%%He raiseth the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%9%%He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%10%%The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%11%%And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%12%%Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%13%%And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%14%%And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%15%%Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of thee, but raw.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%16%%And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, No; but thou shalt give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%17%%Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%18%%But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%19%%Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband, to offer the yearly sacrifice.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%20%%And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee issue of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%21%%And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%22%%Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%23%%And he said to them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%24%%No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%25%%If one man shall sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man shall sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%26%%And the child Samuel continued to grow, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%27%%And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%28%%And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%29%%Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honorest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%30%%Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%31%%Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%32%%And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%33%%And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume thy eyes, and to grieve thy heart: and all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%34%%And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%35%%And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my Anointed for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%2%%36%%And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house, shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest's offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%1%%And the child Samuel ministered to the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%2%%And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to grow dim, that he could not see;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%3%%And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%4%%That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%5%%And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%6%%And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%7%%Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed to him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%8%%And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%9%%Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he should call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%10%%And the LORD came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%11%%And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%12%%In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%13%%For I have told him, that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%14%%And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%15%%And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD: and Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%16%%Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%17%%And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou shalt hide any thing from me, of all the things that he said to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%18%%And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%19%%And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%20%%And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%3%%21%%And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%1%%And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%2%%And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%3%%And when the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh to us, that when it cometh among us, it may save us from the hand of our enemies.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%4%%So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%5%%And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%6%%And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%7%%And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God hath come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%8%%Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%9%%Be strong, and acquit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you: acquit yourselves like men, and fight.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%10%%And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%11%%And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%12%%And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%13%%And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the way-side watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%14%%And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%15%%Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%16%%And the man said to Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%17%%And the messenger answered and said, Israel hath fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%18%%And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%19%%And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law, and her husband were dead, she bowed herself, and travailed; for her pains came upon her.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%20%%And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her said to her, Fear not; for thou hast borne a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%21%%And she named the child I-chabod, saying, The glory hath departed from Israel. (Because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%4%%22%%And she said, The glory hath departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%1%%And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer to Ashdod.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%2%%When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%3%%And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%4%%And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD: and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshhold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%5%%Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshhold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%6%%But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod, and its borders.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%7%%And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is severe upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%8%%They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel thither.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%9%%And it was so, that after they had carried it thither, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%10%%Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%11%%So they sent and convened all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%5%%12%%And the men that died not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%1%%And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%2%%And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us with what we shall send it to its place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%3%%And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass-offering: then ye will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%4%%Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%5%%Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory to the God of Israel: it may be he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%6%%Why then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%7%%Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-cows on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%8%%And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold which ye return to him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%9%%And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know, that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%10%%And the men did so; and took two milch cows, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%11%%And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%12%%And the cows took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%13%%And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%14%%And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered the cows a burnt-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%15%%And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, in which were the jewels of gold, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%16%%And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%17%%And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering to the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%18%%And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities, and of country villages, even to the great stone of Abel, on which they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%19%%And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and seventy men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%20%%And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%6%%21%%And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and bring it up to you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%1%%And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%2%%And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%3%%And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods, and Ashtaroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%4%%Then the children of Israel put away Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%5%%And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%6%%And they assembled at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and there said, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%7%%And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were assembled at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%8%%And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%9%%And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt-offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%10%%And as Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%11%%And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%12%%Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%13%%So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the borders of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%14%%And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the borders of it did Israel deliver from the hands of the Philistines: and there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%15%%And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%16%%And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%7%%17%%And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%1%%And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%2%%Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%3%%And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%4%%Then all the elders of Israel assembled, and came to Samuel to Ramah,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%5%%And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%6%%But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%7%%And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%8%%According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, by which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%9%%Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%10%%And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%11%%And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some will run before his chariots.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%12%%And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%13%%And he will take your daughters to be confectioneries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%14%%And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%15%%And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%16%%And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your most choice young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%17%%He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye will be his servants.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%18%%And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%19%%Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%20%%That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%21%%And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%8%%22%%And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%1%%Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjaminite, a mighty man of power.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%2%%And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a more handsome person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%3%%And the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%4%%And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjaminites, but they found them not.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%5%%And when they had come to the land of Zuf, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and be anxious for us.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%6%%And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; it may be he can show us our way that we should go.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%7%%Then said Saul to his servant, But behold, if we go, what shall we bring to the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%8%%And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%9%%(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%10%%Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go: so they went to the city where the man of God was.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%11%%And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%12%%And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to-day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to-day in the high place:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%13%%As soon as ye shall enter the city, ye will straightway find him, before he goeth up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he cometh, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are invited. Now therefore go up: for about this time ye will find him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%14%%And they went up into the city: and when they had come into the city, behold, Samuel came out meeting them, to go up to the high place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%15%%Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%16%%To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people from the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry has come to me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%17%%And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee! this same shall reign over my people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%18%%Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%19%%And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for ye shall eat with me to-day, and to-morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%20%%And as for thy asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%21%%And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjaminite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then speakest thou so to me?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%22%%And Samuel took Saul, and his servant, and brought them into the parlor, and made them sit in the chief place among them that were invited, who were about thirty persons.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%23%%And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said to thee, Set it by thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%24%%And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat; for to this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%25%%And when they had come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%26%%And they rose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Arise, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%9%%27%%And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may show thee the word of God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%1%%Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%2%%When thou hast departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%3%%Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%4%%And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive from their hands.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%5%%After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou hast come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%6%%And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%7%%And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%8%%And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%9%%And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%10%%And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%11%%And it came to pass when all that formerly knew him saw, that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that hath come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%12%%And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%13%%And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%14%%And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%15%%And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, What Samuel said to you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%16%%And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%17%%And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%18%%And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%19%%And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities, and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%20%%And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%21%%When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%22%%Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man would yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%23%%And they ran and brought him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%24%%And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%25%%Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%26%%And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%10%%27%%But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%1%%Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%2%%And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%3%%And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respit, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel: and then, if there is no man to save us, we will come out to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%4%%Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%5%%And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%6%%And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%7%%And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%8%%And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%9%%And they said to the messengers that came, thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, To-morrow by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and showed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%10%%Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good to you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%11%%And it was so on the morrow, that Saul disposed the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning-watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they who remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%12%%And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%13%%And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to-day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%14%%Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%11%%15%%And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal: and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%1%%And Samuel said to all Israel, behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all that ye said to me, and have made a king over you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%2%%And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%3%%Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed; whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes with it? and I will restore it you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%4%%And they said thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken aught from any man's hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%5%%And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%6%%And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%7%%Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%8%%When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers from Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%9%%And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%10%%And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%11%%And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelt safe.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%12%%And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%13%%Now therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%14%%If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye, and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%15%%But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%16%%Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%17%%Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call to the LORD, and he will send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%18%%So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%19%%And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%20%%And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%21%%And turn ye not aside: for then would ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%22%%For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%23%%Moreover as for me, Far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%24%%Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%12%%25%%But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye will be consumed, both ye and your king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%1%%Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%2%%Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%3%%And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%4%%And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%5%%And the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%6%%When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed) then the people hid themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%7%%And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%8%%And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%9%%And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt-offering to me, and peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offering.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%10%%And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%11%%And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled at Michmash;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%12%%Therefore said I, the Philistines will now come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD; I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt-offering.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%13%%And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%14%%But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%15%%And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%16%%And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%17%%And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leadeth to Ophrah, to the land of Shual:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%18%%And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim towards the wilderness.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%19%%Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: (for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:)
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%20%%But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his colter, and his ax, and his mattock.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%21%%Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the colters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%22%%So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%13%%23%%And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%1%%Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of the Philistines, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%2%%And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%3%%And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%4%%And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%5%%The front of the one was situated northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%6%%And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%7%%And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that is in thy heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%8%%Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to these men, and we will discover ourselves to them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%9%%If they say thus to us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%10%%But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand; and this shall be a sign to us.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%11%%And both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%12%%And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%13%%And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor-bearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor-bearer slew after him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%14%%And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were a half-acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%15%%And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%16%%And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%17%%Then said Saul to the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%18%%And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%19%%And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on, and increased: and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%20%%And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%21%%Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, who went up with them into the camp from the country around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%22%%Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%23%%So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over to Beth-aven.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%24%%And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%25%%And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%26%%And when the people had come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%27%%But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in a honey-comb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%28%%Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%29%%Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%30%%How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%31%%And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon: and the people were very faint.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%32%%And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them with the blood.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%33%%Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone to me this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%34%%And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%35%%And Saul built an altar to the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built to the LORD:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%36%%And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seemeth good to thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither to God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%37%%And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%38%%And Saul said, Draw ye near hither all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%39%%For as the LORD liveth, who saveth Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%40%%Then said he to all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seemeth good to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%41%%Therefore Saul said to the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%42%%And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%43%%Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand, and, lo, I must die.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%44%%And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%45%%And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? By no means: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%46%%Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%47%%So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he harassed them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%48%%And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of them that spoiled them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%49%%Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the first-born Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%50%%And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%51%%And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%14%%52%%And there was violent war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him to himself.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%1%%Samuel also said to Saul, the LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou to the voice of the words of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%2%%Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%3%%Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%4%%And Saul assembled the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%5%%And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%6%%And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, withdraw yourselves from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%7%%And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah, until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%8%%And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%9%%But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%10%%Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%11%%I repent that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%12%%And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a place, and has gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%13%%And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%14%%And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%15%%And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%16%%Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%17%%And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thy own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%18%%And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%19%%Why then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%20%%And Saul said to Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%21%%But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD thy God in Gilgal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%22%%And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%23%%For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%24%%And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%25%%Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%26%%And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%27%%And as Samuel turned about to depart, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%28%%And Samuel said to him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%29%%And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%30%%Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%31%%So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%32%%Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%33%%And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%34%%Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%15%%35%%And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%1%%And the LORD said to Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%2%%And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul shall hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%3%%And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint to me him whom I name to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%4%%And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%5%%And he said, Peaceably: I have come to sacrifice to the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%6%%And it came to pass when they had come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%7%%But the LORD said to Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the hight of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%8%%Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%9%%Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%10%%Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%11%%And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him: for we will not sit down till he hath come hither.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%12%%And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and also of a beautiful countenance, and a good appearance. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%13%%Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose, and went to Ramah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%14%%But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%15%%And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%16%%Let our lord now command thy servants, who are before thee, to seek a man who is a skillful player on a harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he will play with his hand, and thou wilt be well.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%17%%And Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%18%%Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skillful in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%19%%Wherefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send to me David thy son, who is with the sheep.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%20%%And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%21%%And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%22%%And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%16%%23%%And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%1%%Now the Philistines collected their armies to battle, and were assembled at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and encamped between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%2%%And Saul and the men of Israel were assembled and encamped by the valley of Elah, and they set the battle in array against the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%3%%And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%4%%And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose hight was six cubits and a span.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%5%%And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%6%%And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%7%%And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%8%%And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why have ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%9%%If he shall be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I shall prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%10%%And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%11%%When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%12%%Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%13%%And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first-born, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%14%%And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%15%%But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Beth-lehem.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%16%%And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%17%%And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%18%%And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and see how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%19%%Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%20%%And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%21%%For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%22%%And David left his furniture in the hand of the keeper of the vessels, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%23%%And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, from the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%24%%And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were exceedingly afraid.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%25%%And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that hath come up? surely to defy Israel hath he come: and it shall be, that the man who shall kill him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%26%%And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%27%%And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%28%%And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thy heart; for thou art come down that thou mayest see the battle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%29%%And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%30%%And he turned from him towards another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%31%%And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%32%%And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%33%%And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%34%%And David said to Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%35%%And I went after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%36%%Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%37%%David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%38%%And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%39%%And David girded his sword upon his armor, and he essayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved them. And David put them off from him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%40%%And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand; and he drew near to the Philistine.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%41%%And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield went before him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%42%%And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%43%%And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staffs? and the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%44%%And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%45%%Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%46%%This day will the LORD deliver thee into my hand; and I will smite thee, and take thy head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%47%%And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%48%%And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran towards the army to meet the Philistine.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%49%%And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and hurled it with his sling, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%50%%So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%51%%Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath, and slew him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%52%%And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%53%%And the children of Israel returned from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their tents.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%54%%And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%55%%And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%56%%And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%57%%And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%17%%58%%And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%1%%And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%2%%And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%3%%Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%4%%And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%5%%And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%6%%And it came to pass as they came, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%7%%And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%8%%And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands; and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%9%%And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%10%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%11%%And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall. And David escaped from his presence twice.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%12%%And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and had departed from Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%13%%Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%14%%And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%15%%Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%16%%But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%17%%And Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee for a wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%18%%And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%19%%But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%20%%And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%21%%And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law, in the one of the two.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%22%%And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%23%%And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%24%%And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%25%%And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dower, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%26%%And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law: and the days had not expired.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%27%%Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter for a wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%28%%And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%29%%And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%18%%30%%Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much esteemed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%1%%And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%2%%But Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now, therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%3%%And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%4%%And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been toward thee very good:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%5%%For he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: Why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%6%%And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan: and Saul swore, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%7%%And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%8%%And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%9%%And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%10%%And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away from Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%11%%Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If thou dost not save thy life to-night, to-morrow thou wilt be slain.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%12%%So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%13%%And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goat's hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%14%%And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%15%%And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him to me in the bed, that I may slay him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%16%%And when the messengers had come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goat's hair for his bolster.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%17%%And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away my enemy, that he has escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%18%%So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%19%%And it was told to Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%20%%And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%21%%And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%22%%Then he went also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%23%%And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%19%%24%%And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%1%%And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is my iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%2%%And he said to him, Far be it from thee; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing, either great or small, but that he will show it to me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%3%%And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he should be grieved: But truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%4%%Then said Jonathan to David, Whatever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%5%%And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new-moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%6%%If thy father shall at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me, that he might run to Beth-lehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%7%%If he shall say thus, It is well; thy servant will have peace: but if he shall be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%8%%Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there is in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldst thou bring me to thy father?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%9%%And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil is determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%10%%Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father shall answer thee roughly?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%11%%And Jonathan said to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%12%%And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to-morrow any time, or the third day, and behold, if there be good towards David, and I then send not to thee, and show it thee;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%13%%The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it shall please my father to do thee evil, then I will show it to thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%14%%And thou shalt, not only while yet I live, show me the kindness of the LORD, that I may not die:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%15%%But also thou shalt not withdraw thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%16%%So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%17%%And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%18%%Then Jonathan said to David, To-morrow is the new-moon: and thou wilt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%19%%And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%20%%And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%21%%And behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say to the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%22%%But if I say thus to the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%23%%And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%24%%So David hid himself in the field: and when the new-moon had come, the king sat down to eat food.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%25%%And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%26%%Nevertheless Saul spoke not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%27%%And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why cometh not the son of Jesse to eat, neither yesterday, nor to-day?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%28%%And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%29%%And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother he hath commanded me to be there: and now if I have found favor in thy eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not to the king's table.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%30%%Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thy own confusion, and to the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%31%%For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the earth, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%32%%And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why shall he be slain? what hath he done?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%33%%And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: by which Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to slay David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%34%%So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%35%%And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%36%%And he said to his lad, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow, beyond him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%37%%And when the lad had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%38%%And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%39%%But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%40%%And Jonathan gave his arms to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%41%%And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place towards the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%42%%And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.\\
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%20%%43%%And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%1%%Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%2%%And David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said to me, Let no man know any thing of the business about which I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%3%%Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or what there is present.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%4%%And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%5%%And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%6%%So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the show-bread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%7%%Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%8%%And David said to Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%9%%And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%10%%And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%11%%And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%12%%And David laid up these words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%13%%And he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%14%%Then said Achish to his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: why then have ye brought him to me?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%21%%15%%Have I need of mad-men, that ye have brought this man to play the mad-man in my presence? shall this man come into my house?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%1%%David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%2%%And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, resorted to him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%3%%And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%4%%And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%5%%And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%6%%When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%7%%Then Saul said to his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%8%%That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or showeth to me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%9%%Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%10%%And he inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%11%%Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%12%%And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%13%%And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%14%%Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honorable in thy house?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%15%%Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me. Let not the king impute any thing to his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%16%%And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%17%%And the king said to the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not show it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%18%%And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day eighty and five persons that wore a linen ephod.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%19%%And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%20%%And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%21%%And Abiathar showed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%22%%And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%22%%23%%Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%1%%Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing-floors.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%2%%Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%3%%And David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%4%%Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%5%%So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%6%%And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%7%%And it was told to Saul that David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%8%%And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%9%%And David knew that Saul secretly plotted mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%10%%Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%11%%Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%12%%Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%13%%Then David and his men who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah: and he forbore to go forth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%14%%And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%15%%And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%16%%And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%17%%And he said to him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou wilt be king over Israel, and I shall be next to thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%18%%And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%19%%Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%20%%Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%21%%And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%22%%Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told to me that he dealeth very subtilly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%23%%See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%24%%And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%25%%Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%26%%And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men around to take them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%27%%But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%23%%28%%Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Sela-hammah-lekoth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%1%%Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%2%%And it came to pass, when Saul had returned from following the Philistines, that it was told to him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%3%%Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%4%%And he came to the sheep-cotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%5%%And the men of David said to him, Behold the day of which the LORD said to thee, Behold, I will deliver thy enemy into thy hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee. Then David arose, and privately cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%6%%And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%7%%And he said to his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%8%%So David restrained his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose out of the cave, and went on his way.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%9%%David also rose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%10%%And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%11%%Behold, this day thy eyes have seen how the LORD hath delivered thee to-day into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill thee: but my eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%12%%Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%13%%The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%14%%As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%15%%After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%16%%The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thy hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%17%%And it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%18%%And he said to David, thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me with good, whereas I have rewarded thee with evil.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%19%%And thou hast showed this day how thou hast dealt with me; forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thy hand, thou didst not kill me.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%20%%For if a man findeth his enemy, will he let him go away well? wherefore the LORD reward thee with good, for what thou hast done to me this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%21%%And now, behold, I know well that thou wilt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in thy hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%22%%Swear now therefore to me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%24%%23%%And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men repaired to the hold.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%1%%And Samuel died; and all the Israelites assembled, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%2%%And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%3%%Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%4%%And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%5%%And David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%6%%And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thy house, and peace be to all that thou hast.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%7%%And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds who were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there aught missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%8%%Ask thy young men, and they will show thee. Wherefore let the young men find favor in thy eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatever cometh to thy hand, to thy servants, and to thy son David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%9%%And when David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal in the name of David, according to all these words, and ceased.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%10%%And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants in these days that break away every man from his master.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%11%%Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men, whom I know not whence they are?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%12%%So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all these sayings.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%13%%And David said to his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the goods.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%14%%But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%15%%But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%16%%They were a wall to us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%17%%Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do: for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%18%%Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%19%%And she said to her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%20%%And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and behold, David and his men came down over against her; and she met them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%21%%(Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this man hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained to him: and he hath requited me evil for good.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%22%%So and more also do God to the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any male person.)
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%23%%And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%24%%And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy audience, and hear the words of thy handmaid.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%25%%Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%26%%Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withheld thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thy own hand, now let thy enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%27%%And now this blessing which thy handmaid hath brought to my lord, let it even be given to the young men that follow my lord.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%28%%I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%29%%Yet a man hath risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thy enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the middle of a sling.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%30%%And it will come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%31%%That this will be no grief to thee, nor offense of heart to my lord, either that thou hast shed blood without cause, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%32%%And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%33%%And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, who hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with my own hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%34%%For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, who hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male person.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%35%%So David received from her hand that which she had brought him, and said to her, Return in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%36%%And Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: Therefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%37%%But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine had left Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%38%%And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%39%%And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to himself for a wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%40%%And when the servants of David had come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke to her, saying, David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to him for a wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%41%%And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%42%%And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%43%%David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%25%%44%%But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%1%%And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%2%%Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%3%%And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%4%%David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul had come in very deed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%5%%And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched around him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%6%%Then answered David, and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%7%%So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay about him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%8%%Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thy enemy into thy hand this day; now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%9%%And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%10%%David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD will smite him; or his day will come to die; or he will descend into battle and perish.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%11%%The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%12%%So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they departed, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep: because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%13%%Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off; a great space being between them:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%14%%And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%15%%And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came in one of the people to destroy the king thy lord.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%16%%This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%17%%And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? and David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%18%%And he said, Why doth my lord thus pursue his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in my hand?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%19%%Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD hath stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they are the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%20%%Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel hath come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%21%%Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thy eyes this day: behold I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%22%%And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and take it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%23%%The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to-day, but I would not stretch forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%24%%And behold, as thy life was precious this day in my eyes, so let my life be precious in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%26%%25%%Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%1%%And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair of me, to seek me any more in any border of Israel; so shall I escape from his hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%2%%And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%3%%And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess Nabal's wife.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%4%%And it was told to Saul that David had fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%5%%And David said to Achish, If I have now found grace in thy eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%6%%Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth to the kings of Judah to this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%7%%And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%8%%And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%9%%And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%10%%And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to-day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%11%%And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should inform against us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%27%%12%%And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%1%%And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines collected their armies for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%2%%And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of my head for ever.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%3%%Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%4%%And the Philistines assembled, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul collected all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%5%%And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%6%%And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%7%%Then said Saul to his servants, seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at En-dor.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%8%%And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring up for me whom I shall name to thee.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%9%%And the woman said to him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: Why then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%10%%And Saul swore to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%11%%Then said the woman, whom shall I bring up to thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%12%%And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%13%%And the king said to her be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said to Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%14%%And he said to her, What is his form? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%15%%And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am grievously distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God hath departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%16%%Then said Samuel, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD hath departed from thee, and hath become thy enemy?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%17%%And the LORD hath done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thy hand, and given it to thy neighbor, even to David:
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%18%%Because thou didst not obey the voice of the LORD, nor execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing to thee this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%19%%Moreover, the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%20%%Then Saul fell immediately all along on the earth, and was exceedingly afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%21%%And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was greatly troubled, and said to him, Behold, thy handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened to thy words, which thou didst speak
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%22%%Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also to the voice of thy handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%23%%But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%24%%And the woman had a fat calf in the house: and she hasted and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread of it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%28%%25%%And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they arose and went away that night.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%1%%Now the Philistines collected all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites encamped by a fountain which is in Jezreel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%2%%And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear with Achish.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%3%%Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell to me to this day?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%4%%And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make this man return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he should be an adversary to us: for with what would he reconcile himself to his master? would it not be with the heads of these men?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%5%%Is not this David, of whom they sung one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%6%%Then Achish called David, and said to him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee from the day of thy coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords favor thee not.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%7%%Therefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%8%%And David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant, so long as I have been with thee to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%9%%And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%10%%Wherefore now rise early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye shall have risen early in the morning, and have light, depart.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%29%%11%%So David and his men rose early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%1%%And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%2%%And had taken the women captives that were in it, they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%3%%So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%4%%Then David and the people that were with him, lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%5%%And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%6%%And David was greatly distressed: for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons, and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%7%%And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%8%%And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue; for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%9%%So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind remained.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%10%%But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%11%%And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they made him drink water;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%12%%And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drank any water, three days and three nights.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%13%%And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%14%%We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%15%%And David said to him, Canst thou conduct me down to this company? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will lead thee down to this company.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%16%%And when he had conducted him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken from the land of the Philistines, and from the land of Judah.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%17%%And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%18%%And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%19%%And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%20%%And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drove before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%21%%And David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%22%%Then answered all the wicked men, and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%23%%Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%24%%For who will hearken to you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the goods: they shall part alike.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%25%%And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%26%%And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you, of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%27%%To them who were in Beth-el, and to them who were in south Ramoth, and to them who were in Jattir,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%28%%And to them who were in Aroer, and to them who were in Siphmoth, and to them who were in Eshtemoa,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%29%%And to them who were in Rachal, and to them who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them who were in the cities of the Kenites,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%30%%And to them who were in Hormah, and to them who were in Chor-ashan, and to them who were in Athach,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%30%%31%%And to them who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to resort.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%1%%Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%2%%And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%3%%And the battle was severe against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%4%%Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised should come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was exceedingly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%5%%And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%6%%So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, that same day together.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%7%%And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side of Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%8%%And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%9%%And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%10%%And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%11%%And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%12%%All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
1000005%%1 Samuel%%OT%%31%%13%%And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%1%%Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%2%%It came even to pass on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%3%%And David said to him, From whence comest thou? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel have I escaped.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%4%%And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen, and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%5%%And David said to the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%6%%And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%7%%And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%8%%And he said to me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%9%%He said to me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%10%%So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither to my lord.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%11%%Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%12%%And they mourned and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%13%%And David said to the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%14%%And David said to him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%15%%And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%16%%And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%17%%And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul, and over Jonathan his son:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%18%%(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%19%%The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%20%%Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%21%%Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%22%%From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%23%%Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%24%%Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%25%%How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan thou wast slain in thy high places.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%26%%I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been to me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%1%%27%%How have the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%1%%And it came to pass after this, that David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%2%%So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, Nabal's wife the Carmelite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%3%%And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%4%%And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabesh-gilead were they that buried Saul.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%5%%And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%6%%And now the LORD show kindness and truth to you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%7%%Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%8%%But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%9%%And he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%10%%Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years: but the house of Judah followed David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%11%%And the time that David was king in Hebron, over the house of Judah, was seven years and six months.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%12%%And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%13%%And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%14%%And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%15%%Then there arose, and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who pertained to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%16%%And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side: so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%17%%And there was a very severe battle that day; and Abner was defeated, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%18%%And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%19%%And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%20%%Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%21%%And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay hold on one of the young men, and take to thee his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%22%%And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: Why should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%23%%But he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%24%%Joab also, and Abishai pursued Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%25%%And the children of Benjamin assembled themselves after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of a hill.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%26%%Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou wilt bid the people return from following their brethren?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%27%%And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%28%%So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%29%%And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%30%%And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had assembled all the people, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men, and Asahel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%31%%But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and sixty men died.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%2%%32%%And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulcher of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%1%%Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David grew stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%2%%And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his first-born was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%3%%And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%4%%And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%5%%And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%6%%And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%7%%And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in to my father's concubine?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%8%%Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, who against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to-day with a fault concerning this woman?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%9%%So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%10%%To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%11%%And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%12%%And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel to thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%13%%And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou shalt first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%14%%And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, saying, Deliver to me my wife Michal, whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%15%%And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%16%%And her husband went with her, weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%17%%And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%18%%Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%19%%And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%20%%So Abner came to David in Hebron, and twenty men with him: and David made Abner and the men that were with him, a feast.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%21%%And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%22%%And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%23%%When Joab and all the host that was with him had come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he hath gone in peace.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%24%%Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came to thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%25%%Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going-out and thy coming-in, and to know all that thou doest.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%26%%And when Joab had come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%27%%And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%28%%And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%29%%Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%30%%So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%31%%And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%32%%And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%33%%And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%34%%Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%35%%And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, If I taste bread or aught else, till the sun is down.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%36%%And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as what ever the king did pleased all the people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%37%%For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%38%%And the king said to his servants, Know ye not that there hath a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%3%%39%%And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me. The LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%1%%And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%2%%And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (For Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%3%%And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been sojourners there until this day.)
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%4%%And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet: he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%5%%And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%6%%And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%7%%For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bed-chamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went away through the plain all night.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%8%%And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%9%%And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%10%%When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, (thinking to have brought good tidings,) I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%11%%How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%4%%12%%And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the sepulcher of Abner in Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%1%%Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%2%%Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%3%%So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%4%%David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%5%%In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%6%%And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spoke to David, saying, Except thou shalt take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%7%%Nevertheless, David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%8%%And David said on that day, Whoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated by David's soul, he shall be chief and captain: Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%9%%So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built around from Millo and inward.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%10%%And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%11%%And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David a house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%12%%And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%13%%And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%14%%And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%15%%Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%16%%And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%17%%But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%18%%The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%19%%And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%20%%And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%21%%And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%22%%And the Philistines came yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%23%%And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up: but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%24%%And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%5%%25%%And David did so as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gazer.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%1%%Again, David assembled all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%2%%And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%3%%And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%4%%And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%5%%And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%6%%And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it: for the oxen shook it.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%7%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%8%%And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perez-uzzah to this day.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%9%%And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%10%%So David would not remove the ark of the LORD to him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%11%%And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%12%%And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%13%%And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%14%%And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%15%%So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%16%%And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%17%%And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%18%%And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%19%%And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%20%%Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%21%%And David said to Michal, It was before the LORD, who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%22%%And I shall yet be more vile than thus, and shall be base in my own sight: and by the maid-servants which thou hast spoken of, by them shall I be had in honor.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%6%%23%%Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until the day of her death.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%1%%And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest around from all his enemies;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%2%%That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%3%%And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart: for the LORD is with thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%4%%And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%5%%Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%6%%Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent, and in a tabernacle.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%7%%In all the places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel have I spoken a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why do ye not build me a house of cedar?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%8%%Now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant David, thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%9%%And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%10%%Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%11%%And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thy enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee a house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%12%%And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%13%%He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%14%%I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he shall commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%15%%But my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%16%%And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%17%%According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%18%%Then king David went in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%19%%And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%20%%And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%21%%For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%22%%Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%23%%And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%24%%For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people to thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%25%%And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%26%%And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%27%%For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%28%%And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness to thy servant:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%7%%29%%Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%1%%And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%2%%And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines he measured to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%3%%David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%4%%And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot-horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%5%%And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%6%%Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%7%%And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%8%%And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took very much brass.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%9%%When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%10%%Then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: (for Hadadezer had wars with Toi) and Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%11%%Which also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%12%%Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%13%%And David made him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of Salt, being eighteen thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%14%%And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom he put garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%15%%And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%16%%And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%17%%And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests: and Seraiah was the scribe;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%8%%18%%And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%1%%And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%2%%And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him to David, the king said to him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%3%%And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God to him? and Ziba said to the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, who is lame in his feet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%4%%And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%5%%Then king David sent, and brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%6%%Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, had come to David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%7%%And David said to him, Fear not: for I will surely show thee kindness for the sake of Jonathan thy father, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%8%%And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I am?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%9%%Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given to thy master's son all that pertained to Saul, and to all his house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%10%%Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%11%%Then said Ziba to the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%12%%And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micah. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%9%%13%%So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he ate continually at the king's table; and was lame in both his feet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%1%%And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%2%%Then said David, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%3%%And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? hath not David rather sent his servants to thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%4%%Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%5%%When they told it to David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%6%%And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%7%%And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%8%%And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%9%%When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he selected of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%10%%And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%11%%And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%12%%Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%13%%And Joab and the people that were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%14%%And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%15%%And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they assembled themselves.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%16%%And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%17%%And when it was told David, he assembled all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%18%%And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%10%%19%%And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%1%%And it came to pass, after the year had expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and destroyed Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%2%%And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%3%%And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%4%%And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned to her house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%5%%And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%6%%And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%7%%And when Uriah had come to him, David inquired of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%8%%And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%9%%But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%10%%And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down to his house, David said to Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down to thy house?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%11%%And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%12%%And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%13%%And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk: and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%14%%And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%15%%And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the front of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%16%%And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew that valiant men were.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%17%%And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%18%%Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%19%%And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war to the king,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%20%%And if the king's wrath shall rise, and he shall say to thee, Why approached ye so nigh to the city for the fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%21%%Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%22%%So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%23%%And the messenger said to David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were upon them even to the entrance of the gate.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%24%%And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants: and some of the king's servants are dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%25%%Then David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%26%%And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%11%%27%%And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%1%%And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%2%%The rich man had very numerous flocks and herds:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%3%%But the poor man had nothing save one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nourished: and it grew up together with him, and with his children: it fed of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%4%%And there came a traveler to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the way-faring man that had come to him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%5%%And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%6%%And he shall restore the lamb four-fold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%7%%And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee from the hand of Saul;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%8%%And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given to thee such and such things.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%9%%Why hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%10%%Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%11%%Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy eyes, and give them to thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%12%%For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%13%%And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said to David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%14%%But, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to thee shall surely die.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%15%%And Nathan departed to his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it was very sick.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%16%%David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%17%%And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%18%%And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how will he then be grieved, if we tell him that the child is dead?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%19%%But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said to his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%20%%Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshiped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he ate.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%21%%Then said his servants to him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but after the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%22%%And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted, and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%23%%But now he is dead, Why should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%24%%And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%25%%And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%26%%And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%27%%And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%28%%Now therefore collect the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%29%%And David collected all the people, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%30%%And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%12%%31%%And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%1%%And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%2%%And Amnon was so afflicted, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%3%%But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%4%%And he said to him, Why art thou, being the king's son, pining from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%5%%And Jonadab said to him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say to him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me food, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%6%%So Amnon lay down and made himself sick: and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make for me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%7%%Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress meat for him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%8%%So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%9%%And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%10%%And Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%11%%And when she had brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%12%%And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%13%%And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou wilt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%14%%Howbeit, he would not hearken to her voice: but being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%15%%Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%16%%And she said to him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst to me. But he would not hearken to her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%17%%Then he called his servant that ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%18%%And she had a garment of divers colors upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%19%%And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colors that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%20%%And Absalom her brother said to her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%21%%But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%22%%And Absalom spoke to his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%23%%And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%24%%And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheep-shearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%25%%And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable to thee. And he pressed him: yet he would not go, but blessed him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%26%%Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with thee?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%27%%But Absalom pressed him that he should let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%28%%Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have I not commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%29%%And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man rode upon his mule, and fled.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%30%%And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that information came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%31%%Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%32%%And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%33%%Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%34%%But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came many people by the way of the hillside behind him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%35%%And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons come; as thy servant said, so it is.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%36%%And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept exceedingly.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%37%%But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%38%%So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%13%%39%%And the soul of king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%1%%Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was towards Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%2%%And Joab sent to Tekoah, and brought thence a wise woman, and said to her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%3%%And come to the king, and speak in this manner to him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%4%%And when the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%5%%And the king said to her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%6%%And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%7%%And behold, the whole family hath risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they will quench my coal which is left, and will not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%8%%And the king said to the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give charge concerning thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%9%%And the woman of Tekoah said to the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%10%%And the king said, Whoever saith aught to thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%11%%Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%12%%Then the woman said, Let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%13%%And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one who is faulty, in that the king doth not bring home again his banished.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%14%%For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%15%%Now therefore that I have come to speak of this thing to my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%16%%For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid from the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%17%%Then thy handmaid said, The word of my lord the king, will now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%18%%Then the king answered and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%19%%And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%20%%To bring about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are on the earth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%21%%And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%22%%And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To-day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%23%%So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%24%%And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%25%%But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%26%%And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%27%%And to Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%28%%So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%29%%Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, that he might send him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%30%%Therefore he said to his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%31%%Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom, to his house, and said to him, Why have thy servants set my field on fire?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%32%%And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent to thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me had I been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there is any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%14%%33%%So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%1%%And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%2%%And Absalom rose early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is one of the tribes of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%3%%And Absalom said to him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%4%%Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man who hath any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%5%%And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%6%%And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%7%%And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%8%%For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%9%%And the king said to him, Go in peace, So he arose, and went to Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%10%%But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%11%%And with Absalom went two hundred men from Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%12%%And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%13%%And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%14%%And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he should overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%15%%And the king's servants said to the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall appoint.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%16%%And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women who were concubines to keep the house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%17%%And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%18%%And all his servants passed on by his side; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%19%%Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king; for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%20%%Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may; return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%21%%And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%22%%And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%23%%And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, towards the way of the wilderness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%24%%And lo, Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%25%%And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%26%%But if he shall thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good to him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%27%%The king said also to Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%28%%See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until word shall come from you to certify me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%29%%Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%30%%And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%31%%And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%32%%And it came to pass, that when David had come to the top of the mount, where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%33%%To whom David said, If thou shalt pass on with me, then thou wilt be a burden to me:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%34%%But if thou shalt return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%35%%And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that whatever thing thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%36%%Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send to me every thing that ye can hear.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%15%%37%%So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%1%%And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%2%%And the king said to Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%3%%And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%4%%Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%5%%And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%6%%And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%7%%And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%8%%The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%9%%Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%10%%And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said to him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Why hast thou done so?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%11%%And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjaminite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%12%%It may be that the LORD will look on my affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%13%%And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%14%%And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%15%%And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%16%%And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, had come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%17%%And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%18%%And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%19%%And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%20%%Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%21%%And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred by thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%22%%So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%16%%23%%And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%1%%Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%2%%And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%3%%And I will bring back all the people to thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%4%%And the saying, pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%5%%Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%6%%And when Hushai had come to Absalom, Absalom spoke to him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%7%%And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given, is not good at this time.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%8%%For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%9%%Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them are overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%10%%And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they who are with him are valiant men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%11%%Therefore I counsel that all Israel should be generally gathered to thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou shouldst go to battle in thy own person.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%12%%So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%13%%Moreover, if he shall have entered into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there is not one small stone found there.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%14%%And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%15%%Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%16%%Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%17%%Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a maid servant went and told them; and they went and told king David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%18%%Nevertheless, a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; into which they descended.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%19%%And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn upon it; and the thing was not known.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%20%%And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, they have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%21%%And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came out of the well, and went and told king David, and said to David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counseled against you.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%22%%Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that had not gone over Jordan.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%23%%And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died. and was buried in the sepulcher of his father.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%24%%Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%25%%And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra, an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab's mother.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%26%%So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%27%%And it came to pass, when David had come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%28%%Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentils, and parched pulse,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%17%%29%%And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of cows, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%1%%And David numbered the people that were with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%2%%And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%3%%But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou shouldst succor us out of the city.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%4%%And the king said to them, What seemeth to you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%5%%And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%6%%So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%7%%Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%8%%For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%9%%And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was suspended between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%10%%And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%11%%And Joab said to the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%12%%And the man said to Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%13%%Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against my own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%14%%Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%15%%And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%16%%And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel: for Joab restrained the people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%17%%And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%18%%Now Absalom in his life-time had taken and raised for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called to this day, Absalom's place.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%19%%Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and inform the king, how the LORD hath avenged himself of his enemies.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%20%%And Joab said to him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%21%%Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself to Joab, and ran.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%22%%Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But however, let me also, I pray thee, run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%23%%But however, said he, let me run. And he said to him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and outran Cushi.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%24%%And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%25%%And the watchman called, and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%26%%And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called to the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%27%%And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good news.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%28%%And Ahimaaz called, and said to the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, who hath delivered up the men that raised their hand against my lord the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%29%%And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%30%%And the king said to him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%31%%And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%32%%And the king said to Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, May the enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%18%%33%%And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! O that I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%1%%And it was told to Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%2%%And the victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people: for the people heard it said that day how the king was grieved for his son.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%3%%And the people withdrew by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%4%%But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%5%%And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, who this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%6%%In that thou lovest thy enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%7%%Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably to thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou shalt not go forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse to thee than all the evil that hath befallen thee from thy youth until now.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%8%%Then the king rose, and sat in the gate. And they told to all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%9%%And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us from the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us from the hand of the Philistines; and now he hath fled out of the land for Absalom.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%10%%And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%11%%And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%12%%Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: why then are ye the last to bring back the king?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%13%%And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%14%%And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%15%%So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%16%%And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite, who was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%17%%And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%18%%And there went over a ferry-boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he came over Jordan;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%19%%And said to the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity to me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%20%%For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore behold, I have come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%21%%But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%22%%And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries to me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%23%%Therefore the king said to Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore to him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%24%%And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%25%%And it came to pass, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%26%%And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride on it, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%27%%And he hath slandered thy servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thy eyes.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%28%%For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that ate at thy own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more to the king?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%29%%And the king said to him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%30%%And Mephibosheth said to the king, Yes, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king hath come again in peace to his own house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%31%%And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%32%%Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim: for he was a very great man.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%33%%And the king said to Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%34%%And Barzillai said to the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%35%%I am this day eighty years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women? why then should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%36%%Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense me with such a reward?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%37%%Let thy servant, I pray thee, return again, that I may die in my own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%38%%And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to thee: and whatever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%39%%And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king had come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%40%%Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%41%%And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to him, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%42%%And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: why then are ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all at the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%19%%43%%And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%1%%And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%2%%So every man of Israel, withdrawing from David, followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%3%%And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in custody, and fed them, but went not in to them. So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%4%%Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble to me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%5%%So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%6%%And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue him, lest he get for himself fortified cities, and escape us.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%7%%And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%8%%When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath; and as he went forth it fell out.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%9%%And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%10%%But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%11%%And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoreth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%12%%And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%13%%When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%14%%And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were assembled, and went also after him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%15%%And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%16%%Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, to Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%17%%And when he was come near to her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%18%%Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They will surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%19%%I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%20%%And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%21%%The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%22%%Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%23%%Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%24%%And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%25%%And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%20%%26%%And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%1%%Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%2%%And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them, in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%3%%Wherefore David said to the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and with what shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%4%%And the Gibeonites said to him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%5%%And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining within the borders of Israel,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%6%%Let seven men of his sons be delivered to us, and we will hang them up to the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD chose. And the king said, I will give them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%7%%But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%8%%But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%9%%And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%10%%And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%11%%And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah the concubine of Saul had done.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%12%%And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%13%%And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%14%%And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son they buried in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulcher of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was entreated for the land.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%15%%Moreover, the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David became faint.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%16%%And Ishbi-benob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%17%%But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, Thou shalt go out no more with us to battle, that thou mayest not extinguish the light of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%18%%And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%19%%And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Beth-lehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%20%%And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%21%%And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%21%%22%%These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%1%%And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%2%%And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%3%%The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my preserver; thou savest me from violence.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%4%%I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%5%%When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly-men made me afraid;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%6%%The sorrows of hell encompassed me; the snares of death seized me;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%7%%In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry entered into his ears.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%8%%Then the earth shook and trembled: the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%9%%There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%10%%He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%11%%And he rode upon a cherub, and flew: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%12%%And he made darkness pavilions around him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%13%%Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%14%%The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%15%%And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%16%%And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were laid open, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%17%%He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%18%%He delivered me from my strong enemy, from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%19%%They fell upon me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my support.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%20%%He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%21%%The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%22%%For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%23%%For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%24%%I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%25%%Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye-sight.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%26%%With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%27%%With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt contend.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%28%%And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thy eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%29%%For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%30%%For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%31%%As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%32%%For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%33%%God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%34%%He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%35%%He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%36%%Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%37%%Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet have not slipped.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%38%%I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%39%%And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they have fallen under my feet.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%40%%For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%41%%Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%42%%They looked, but there was none to save; even to the LORD, but he answered them not.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%43%%Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I stamped them as the mire of the street, and spread them abroad.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%44%%Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%45%%Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%46%%Strangers shall fade away, and they shall tremble from their close places.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%47%%The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%48%%It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%49%%And that bringeth me forth from my enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%50%%Therefore I will give thanks to thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to thy name.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%22%%51%%He is the tower of salvation for his king: and he showeth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%1%%Now these are the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%2%%The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and his word was on my tongue.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%3%%The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%4%%And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%5%%Although my house is not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he maketh it not to grow.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%6%%But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%7%%But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%8%%These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%9%%And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there assembled to battle, and the men of Israel had gone away:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%10%%He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand adhered to the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to plunder.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%11%%And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were collected into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%12%%But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%13%%And three of the thirty chiefs went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%14%%And David was then in a hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Beth-lehem.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%15%%And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, which is by the gate!
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%16%%And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%17%%And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%18%%And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%19%%Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: yet he attained not to the first three.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%20%%And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion-like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%21%%And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%22%%These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among three mighty men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%23%%He was more honorable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%23%%24%%Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Beth-lehem,

1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%1%%And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go number Israel and Judah.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%2%%For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%3%%And Joab said to the king, Now the LORD thy God add to the people, how many soever they may be, a hundred-fold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%4%%Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%5%%And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and towards Jazer:
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%6%%Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%7%%And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%8%%So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%9%%And Joab presented the sum of the number of the people to the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%10%%And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%11%%For when David had risen in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%12%%Go and say to David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%13%%So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? Now consider, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%14%%And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%15%%So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%16%%And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%17%%And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%18%%And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%19%%And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%20%%And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming towards him: And Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%21%%And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor of thee, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%22%%And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good to him: behold, here are oxen for burnt-sacrifice, and threshing-instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%23%%All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%24%%And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt-offerings to the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
1000005%%2 Samuel%%OT%%24%%25%%And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%1%%Now king David was old and advanced in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%2%%Wherefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%3%%So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunamite, and brought her to the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%4%%And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%5%%Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%6%%And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bore him after Absalom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%7%%And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah, helped him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%8%%But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%9%%And Adonijah slew sheep, and oxen, and fat cattle, by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%10%%But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%11%%Wherefore Nathan spoke to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%12%%Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thy own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%13%%Go, and enter in to king David, and say to him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%14%%Behold, while thou art yet talking there with the king, I will also come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%15%%And Bath-sheba went to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunamite ministered to the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%16%%And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What wouldst thou?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%17%%And she said to him, My lord, thou didst swear by the LORD thy God to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%18%%And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%19%%And he hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%20%%And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldst tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%21%%Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%22%%And lo, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%23%%And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%24%%And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%25%%For he hath gone down this day, and hath slain oxen, and fat cattle, and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%26%%But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%27%%Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shown it to thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%28%%Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%29%%And the king swore, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%30%%Even as I swore to thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%31%%Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%32%%And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%33%%The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%34%%And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%35%%Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%36%%And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%37%%As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so let him be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%38%%So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%39%%And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%40%%And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%41%%And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%42%%And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said to him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%43%%And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%44%%And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%45%%And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they have come from thence rejoicing, so that the city resounded. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%46%%And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%47%%And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%48%%And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%49%%And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and arose, and went every man his way.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%50%%And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%51%%And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me to-day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%52%%And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%1%%53%%So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%1%%Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%2%%I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%3%%And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%4%%That the LORD may continue his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%5%%Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%6%%Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoary head go down to the grave in peace.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%7%%But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%8%%And behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjaminite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%9%%Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do to him; but his hoary head do thou bring down to the grave with blood.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%10%%So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%11%%And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%12%%Then Solomon was seated upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%13%%And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? and he said, Peaceably.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%14%%He said moreover, I have somewhat to say to thee. And she said, Say on.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%15%%And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: but the kingdom is turned about, and hath become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%16%%And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said to him, Say on.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%17%%And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king, (for he will not say to thee no,) that he give me Abishag the Shunamite for a wife.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%18%%And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%19%%Bath-sheba therefore went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%20%%Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, deny me not. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not deny thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%21%%And she said, Let Abishag the Shunamite be given to Adonijah thy brother for a wife.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%22%%And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%23%%Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah hath not spoken this word against his own life.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%24%%Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, who hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%25%%And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%26%%And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Depart to Anathoth, to thy own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%27%%So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the LORD; that he might fulfill the word of the LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%28%%Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%29%%And it was told to king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tabernacle of the LORD; and behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%30%%And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said to him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, No; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%31%%And the king said to him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%32%%And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing of it, to wit, Abner the son of Ner captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%33%%Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace forever from the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%34%%So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%35%%And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army: and Zadok the priest the king put in the room of Abiathar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%36%%And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence to any place whatever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%37%%For it shall be, that on the day thou shalt go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thy own head.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%38%%And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%39%%And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, behold, thy servants are in Gath.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%40%%And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%41%%And it was told to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had returned.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%42%%And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest any where abroad, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%43%%Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%44%%The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD will return thy wickedness upon thy own head;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%45%%And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%2%%46%%So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%1%%And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem on every side.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%2%%Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built to the name of the LORD, until those days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%3%%And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%4%%And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%5%%In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%6%%And Solomon said, Thou hast shown to thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%7%%And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%8%%And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%9%%Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%10%%And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%11%%And God said to him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thy enemies: but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%12%%Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like to thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%13%%And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there shall not be any among the kings like to thee all thy days,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%14%%And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%15%%And Solomon awoke; and behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt-offerings, and offered peace-offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%16%%Then came there two women, that were harlots, to the king, and stood before him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%17%%And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%18%%And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save us two in the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%19%%And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%20%%And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%21%%And when I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I bore.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%22%%And the other woman said, No; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spoke before the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%23%%Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith, No; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%24%%And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%25%%And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%26%%Then spoke the woman whose the living child was to the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%27%%Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother of it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%3%%28%%And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%1%%So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%2%%And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%3%%Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehosaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%4%%And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the army: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%5%%And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%6%%And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%7%%And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%8%%And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%9%%The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%10%%The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%11%%The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; who had Taphath the daughter of Solomon for a wife:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%12%%Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%13%%The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brazen bars:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%14%%Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%15%%Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon for a wife:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%16%%Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%17%%Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%18%%Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%19%%Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the land.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%20%%Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%21%%And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%22%%And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%23%%Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowls.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%24%%For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side of the river: and he had peace on all sides around him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%25%%And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%26%%And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%27%%And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came to king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%28%%Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries they brought to the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%29%%And God gave Solomon great wisdom and understanding, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%30%%And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%31%%For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the surrounding nations.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%32%%And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%33%%And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spoke also of beasts, and of fowls, and of creeping animals, and of fishes.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%4%%34%%And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%1%%And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%2%%And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%3%%Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%4%%But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%5%%And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house to my name.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%6%%Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%7%%And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given to David a wise son over this great people.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%8%%And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will perform all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%9%%My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%10%%So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%11%%And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%12%%And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%13%%And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%14%%And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the levy.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%15%%And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%16%%Besides the chief of Solomon's officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%17%%And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%5%%18%%And Solomon's builders, and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%1%%And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%2%%And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits, and the hight of it thirty cubits.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%3%%And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length of it, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth of it, before the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%4%%And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%5%%And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%6%%The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%7%%And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%8%%The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%9%%So he built the house and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%10%%And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%11%%And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%12%%Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spoke to David thy father:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%13%%And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%14%%So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%15%%And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%16%%And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%17%%And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%18%%And the cedar of the house within was carved with knobs and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%19%%And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%20%%And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the hight of it, and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%21%%So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%22%%And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%23%%And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%24%%And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%25%%And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%26%%The hight of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%27%%And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%28%%And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%29%%And he carved all the walls of the house around with carved figures of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, within and without.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%30%%And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%31%%And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side-posts were a fifth part of the wall.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%32%%The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim, and upon the palm trees.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%33%%So also he made for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%34%%And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%35%%And he carved thereon cherubim, and palm trees, and open flowers; and covered them with gold, fitted upon the carved work.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%36%%And he built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone, and a row of cedar beams.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%37%%In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%6%%38%%And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul (which is the eighth month) was the house finished throughout all its parts, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%1%%But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%2%%He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was a hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits, and its hight thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%3%%And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%4%%And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%5%%And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%6%%And he made a porch of pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beams were before them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%7%%Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%8%%And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also a house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married, like to this porch.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%9%%All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewn stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside towards the great court.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%10%%And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones; stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%11%%And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewn stones, and cedars.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%12%%And the great court around was with three rows of hewn stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%13%%And king Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%14%%He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and ingenious to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%15%%For he cast two pillars of brass, each of eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits did encompass each of them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%16%%And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the hight of the one capital was five cubits, and the hight of the other capital was five cubits:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%17%%And nets of checker-work, and wreaths of chain-work, for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%18%%And he made the pillars, and two rows around upon the one net-work, to cover the capitals that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so he did for the other capital.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%19%%And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily-work in the porch, four cubits.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%20%%And the capitals upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the net-work: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows around upon the other capital.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%21%%And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called its name Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called its name Boaz.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%22%%And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work: so was the work of the pillars finished.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%23%%And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was entirely round, and its hight was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%24%%And under the brim of it around there were knobs compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea around: the knobs were cast in two rows, when it was cast.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%25%%It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%26%%And it was a hand-breadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%27%%And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and three cubits the hight of it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%28%%And the work of the bases was in this manner: They had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%29%%And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%30%%And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners of it had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%31%%And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth of it was round after the work of the base, a cubit and a half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%32%%And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the hight of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%33%%And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their fellies, and their spokes, were all molten.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%34%%And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%35%%And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base its ledges and its borders were of the same.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%36%%For on the plates of its ledges, and on its borders, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions around.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%37%%After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%38%%Then he made ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%39%%And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%40%%And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he executed for king Solomon for the house of the LORD:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%41%%The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two net-works, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%42%%And four hundred pomegranates for the two net-works, even two rows of pomegranates for one net-work, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%43%%And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%44%%And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%45%%And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%46%%In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%47%%And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were very numerous: neither was the weight of the brass ascertained.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%48%%And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, upon which was the show-bread,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%49%%And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%50%%And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%7%%51%%So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he placed among the treasures of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%1%%Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%2%%And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%3%%And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%4%%And they brought the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%5%%And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%6%%And the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%7%%For the cherubim spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staffs thereof above.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%8%%And they drew out the staffs, that the ends of the staffs were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are to this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%9%%There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses deposited there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%10%%And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%11%%So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%12%%Then spoke Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%13%%I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%14%%And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel were standing.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%15%%And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%16%%Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel from Egypt, I have chosen no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%17%%And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%18%%And the LORD said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was in thy heart.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%19%%Nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%20%%And the LORD hath performed his word that he spoke, and I have risen in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%21%%And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them from the land of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%22%%And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards Heaven:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%23%%And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%24%%Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him: thou didst speak also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%25%%Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%26%%And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou didst speak to thy servant David my father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%27%%But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%28%%Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee this day:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%29%%That thy eyes may be open towards this house night and day, even towards the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall make towards this place.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%30%%And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray towards this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%31%%If any man shall trespass against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thy altar in this house:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%32%%Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%33%%When thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication to thee in this house:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%34%%Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%35%%When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%36%%Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou mayest teach them the good way in which they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%37%%If there shall be in the land famine, if there shall be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there shall be caterpillar; if their enemy shall besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague, whatever sickness there shall be;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%38%%Whatever prayer and supplication shall be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands towards this house:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%39%%Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%40%%That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%41%%Moreover, concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%42%%(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy out-stretched arm;) when he shall come and pray towards this house;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%43%%Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%44%%If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray to the LORD towards the city which thou hast chosen, and towards the house that I have built for thy name:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%45%%Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%46%%If they shall sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou shalt be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%47%%Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent and make supplication to thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%48%%And so return to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive, and pray to thee towards their land, which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%49%%Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling-place, and maintain their cause,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%50%%And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%51%%For they are thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou broughtest out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%52%%That thy eyes may be open to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all their supplications to thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%53%%For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%54%%And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees, with his hands spread up to heaven.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%55%%And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%56%%Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%57%%The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%58%%That he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%59%%And let these my words with which I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh to the LORD our God day and night, that he may maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%60%%That all the people of the earth may know, that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%61%%Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%62%%And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%63%%And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace-offerings, which he offered to the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%64%%The same day did the king consecrate the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%65%%And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entrance into Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%8%%66%%On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%1%%And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to perform,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%2%%That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%3%%And the LORD said to him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%4%%And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%5%%Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%6%%But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%7%%Then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them; and this house which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by-word among all people:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%8%%And at this house which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%9%%And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers from the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshiped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%10%%And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%11%%(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%12%%And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%13%%And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%14%%And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%15%%And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%16%%For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%17%%And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%18%%And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%19%%And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%20%%And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%21%%Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond-service to this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%22%%But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond-men: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%23%%These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%24%%But Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her: then he built Millo.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%25%%And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%26%%And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%27%%And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%9%%28%%And they came to Ophir, and imported from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%1%%And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%2%%And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%3%%And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%4%%And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%5%%And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%6%%And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%7%%Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%8%%Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%9%%Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore he made thee king, to do judgment and justice.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%10%%And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices a very great quantity, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%11%%And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%12%%And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug-trees, nor have they been seen to this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%13%%And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%14%%Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty six talents of gold,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%15%%Besides what he had of the merchants, and of the traffic of the spice-merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%16%%And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%17%%And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%18%%Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%19%%The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%20%%And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%21%%And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%22%%For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%23%%So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%24%%And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%25%%And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%26%%And Solomon collected chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%27%%And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%28%%And Solomon had horses brought from Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%10%%29%%And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%1%%But king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%2%%Of the nations concerning which the LORD said to the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in to you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon cleaved to these in love.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%3%%And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%4%%For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%5%%For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%6%%And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%7%%Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%8%%And likewise did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%9%%And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%10%%And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%11%%Wherefore the LORD said to Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done by thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%12%%Notwithstanding, in thy days, I will not do it, for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%13%%Yet, I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%14%%And the LORD stirred up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%15%%For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%16%%(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%17%%That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%18%%And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them from Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt; who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%19%%And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him for a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%20%%And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%21%%And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%22%%Then Pharaoh said to him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own country? And he answered, Nothing: yet, in any wise let me go.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%23%%And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%24%%And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt in it, and reigned in Damascus.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%25%%And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%26%%And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he raised his hand against the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%27%%And this was the cause why he raised his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%28%%And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon, seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%29%%And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%30%%And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%31%%And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%32%%(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%33%%Because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%34%%Yet I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%35%%But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to thee, even ten tribes.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%36%%And to his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for me to put my name there.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%37%%And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%38%%And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken to all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%39%%And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%40%%Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%41%%And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%42%%And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%11%%43%%And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%1%%And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%2%%And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he had fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%3%%That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%4%%Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%5%%And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%6%%And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%7%%And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant to this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%8%%But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that had grown up with him, and who stood before him:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%9%%And he said to them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%10%%And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak to this people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%11%%And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%12%%So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%13%%And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%14%%And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%15%%Wherefore the king hearkened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%16%%So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thy own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%17%%But as for the children of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%18%%Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to enter his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%19%%So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%20%%And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%21%%And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%22%%But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%23%%Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%24%%Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%25%%Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt in it, and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%26%%And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%27%%If this people go up to perform sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%28%%Upon which the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%29%%And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other he placed in Dan.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%30%%And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%31%%And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%32%%And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%12%%33%%So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%1%%And behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%2%%And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%3%%And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%4%%And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, who had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it to him again.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%5%%The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%6%%And the king answered and said to the man of God, Entreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored to him again, and became as it was before.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%7%%And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%8%%And the man of God said to the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%9%%For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%10%%So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%11%%Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken to the king, them they told also to their father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%12%%And their father said to them, What way went he? for his sons had seen what way the man of God went, who came from Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%13%%And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode upon it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%14%%And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%15%%Then he said to him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%16%%And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%17%%For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%18%%He said to him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%19%%So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank water.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%20%%And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came to the prophet that brought him back:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%21%%And he cried to the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%22%%But hast returned, and hast eaten bread and drank water in the place, of which the LORD said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come to the sepulcher of thy fathers.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%23%%And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drank, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%24%%And when he had gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcass was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcass.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%25%%And behold, men passed by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcass: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%26%%And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient to the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him to the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke to him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%27%%And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%28%%And he went and found his carcass cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcass: the lion had not eaten the carcass, nor torn the ass.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%29%%And the prophet took up the carcass of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%30%%And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%31%%And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulcher in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%32%%For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%33%%After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%13%%34%%And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from the face of the earth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%1%%At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%2%%And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou mayest not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, who told me that I should be king over this people.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%3%%And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he will tell thee what shall become of the child.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%4%%And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%5%%And the LORD said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say to her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%6%%And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%7%%Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%8%%And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%9%%But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%10%%Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it is all gone.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%11%%Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%12%%Arise thou therefore, depart to thy own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%13%%And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing towards the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%14%%Moreover, the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%15%%For the LORD will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%16%%And he will give up Israel because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned, and who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%17%%And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshhold of the door, the child died;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%18%%And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%19%%And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%20%%And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%21%%And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%22%%And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%23%%For they also built for themselves high places, and images and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%24%%And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%25%%And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%26%%And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%27%%And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%28%%And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%29%%Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%30%%And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%14%%31%%And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%1%%Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%2%%Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%3%%And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%4%%Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%5%%Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%6%%And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%7%%Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%8%%And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%9%%And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%10%%And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%11%%And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%12%%And he banished the sodomites from the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%13%%And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%14%%But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%15%%And he brought the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%16%%And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%17%%And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%18%%Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%19%%There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent to thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%20%%So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of the armies which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%21%%And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%22%%Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and its timber, with which Baasha had built it; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%23%%The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%24%%And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%25%%And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%26%%And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%27%%And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%28%%Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%29%%And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%30%%Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation with which he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%31%%Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%32%%And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%33%%In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%15%%34%%And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%1%%Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%2%%Forasmuch as I exalted thee from the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%3%%Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%4%%Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%5%%Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%6%%So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%7%%And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%8%%In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%9%%And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%10%%And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%11%%And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one male, neither of his kinsman, nor of his friends.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%12%%Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha, by Jehu the prophet,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%13%%For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%14%%Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%15%%In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%16%%And the people that were encamped heard it said, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%17%%And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%18%%And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%19%%For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%20%%Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%21%%Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%22%%But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%23%%In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%24%%And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%25%%But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%26%%For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%27%%Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%28%%So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%29%%And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%30%%And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%31%%And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%32%%And he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%33%%And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%16%%34%%In his days Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiram his first-born, and set up the gates of it in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%1%%And Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%2%%And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%3%%Depart hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%4%%And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%5%%So he went and did according to the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%6%%And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%7%%And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%8%%And the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%9%%Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%10%%So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%11%%And as she was going to bring it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%12%%And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%13%%And Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me of it a little cake first, and bring it to me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%14%%For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%15%%And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%16%%And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Elijah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%17%%And it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe, that there was no breath left in him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%18%%And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%19%%And he said to her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%20%%And he cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%21%%And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried to the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%22%%And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%23%%And Elijah took the child, and brought him down from the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%17%%24%%And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%1%%And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself to Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%2%%And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And there was a grievous famine in Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%3%%And Ahab called Obadiah who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%4%%For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%5%%And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: it may be we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%6%%So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%7%%And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%8%%And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%9%%And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%10%%As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation nor kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%11%%And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%12%%And it will come to pass, as soon as I have gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD will carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he will slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%13%%Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%14%%And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he will slay me.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%15%%And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to-day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%16%%So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%17%%And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%18%%And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%19%%Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, who eat at Jezebel's table.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%20%%So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets to mount Carmel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%21%%And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD is God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%22%%Then said Elijah to the people, I even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophet's are four hundred and fifty men.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%23%%Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%24%%And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%25%%And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%26%%And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%27%%And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleepeth, and must be awaked.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%28%%And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%29%%And it came to pass, when mid-day was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%30%%And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%31%%And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%32%%And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%33%%And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt-sacrifice, and on the wood.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%34%%And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%35%%And the water ran around the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%36%%And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%37%%Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%38%%Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt-sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%39%%And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%40%%And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%41%%And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%42%%So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%43%%And said to his servant, Go up now, look towards the sea. And he went up and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%44%%And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and go down, that the rain may not hinder thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%45%%And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%18%%46%%And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%1%%And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%2%%Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%3%%And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%4%%But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper-tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%5%%And as he lay and slept under a juniper-tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%6%%And he looked, and behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he ate and drank, and laid himself down again.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%7%%And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat, because the journey is too great for thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%8%%And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%9%%And he came thither to a cave, and lodged there; and behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%10%%And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life to take it away.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%11%%And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%12%%And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%13%%And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%14%%And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%15%%And the LORD said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%16%%And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%17%%And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%18%%Yet I have left to me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%19%%So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%20%%And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%19%%21%%And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%1%%And Ben-hadad the king of Syria collected all his army: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%2%%And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said to him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%3%%Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the most comely, are mine.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%4%%And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%5%%And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although I have sent to thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver to me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%6%%Yet I will send my servants to thee to-morrow about this time, and they shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatever is pleasant in thy eyes, they shall take it in their hand, and carry it away.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%7%%Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold, and I denied him not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%8%%And all the elders and all the people said to him, Hearken not to him, nor consent.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%9%%Wherefore he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first, I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%10%%And Ben-hadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%11%%And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%12%%And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said to his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%13%%And behold, there came a prophet to Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thy hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%14%%And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%15%%Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%16%%And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%17%%And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%18%%And he said, Whether they have come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they have come out for war, take them alive.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%19%%So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%20%%And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%21%%And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%22%%And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said to him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%23%%And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%24%%And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%25%%And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%26%%And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%27%%And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%28%%And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thy hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%29%%And they encamped one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%30%%But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%31%%And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: it may be he will save thy life.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%32%%So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%33%%Now the men diligently observed whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%34%%And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%35%%And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%36%%Then said he to him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou hast departed from me, a lion will slay thee. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%37%%Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%38%%So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%39%%And as the king passed by, he cried to the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man to me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he shall be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%40%%And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%41%%And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%42%%And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%20%%43%%And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%1%%And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%2%%And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or if it seemeth good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%3%%And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%4%%And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid himself down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%5%%But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%6%%And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it pleaseth thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%7%%And Jezebel his wife said to him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thy heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%8%%So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%9%%And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%10%%And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%11%%And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%12%%They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%13%%And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%14%%Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%15%%And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%16%%And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%17%%And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%18%%Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%19%%And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak to him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%20%%And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%21%%Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%22%%And will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%23%%And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, the dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%24%%Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%25%%But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife instigated.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%26%%And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%27%%And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%28%%And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%21%%29%%Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%1%%And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%2%%And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%3%%And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we are still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%4%%And he said to Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%5%%And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%6%%Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%7%%And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%8%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%9%%Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%10%%And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%11%%And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou hast consumed them.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%12%%And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver it into the king's hand.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%13%%And the messenger that went to call Micaiah, spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%14%%And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith to me, that will I speak.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%15%%So he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%16%%And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%17%%And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%18%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%19%%And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%20%%And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said in this manner, and another said in that manner.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%21%%And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%22%%And the LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets? And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%23%%Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%24%%But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%25%%And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%26%%And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%27%%And say, Thus saith the king, Put this man in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction, and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%28%%And Micaiah said, If thou shalt return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%29%%So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%30%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%31%%But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%32%%And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%33%%And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%34%%And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%35%%And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at evening: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%36%%And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the setting of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%37%%So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%38%%And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armor; according to the word of the LORD which he spoke.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%39%%Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%40%%So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%41%%And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%42%%Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%43%%And he walked in all the way of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:\\
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%44%%nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%45%%And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%46%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%47%%And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he removed from the land.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%48%%There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%49%%Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%50%%Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%51%%And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%52%%Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%53%%And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:
1000005%%1 Kings%%OT%%22%%54%%For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%1%%Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%2%%And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this disease.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%3%%But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%4%%Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%5%%And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%6%%And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%7%%And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%8%%And they answered him, He was a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%9%%Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and behold, he sat on the top of a hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%10%%And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%11%%Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%12%%And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%13%%And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%14%%Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%15%%And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%16%%And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%17%%So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%1%%18%%Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%1%%And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%2%%And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Beth-el.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%3%%And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%4%%And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%5%%And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold ye your peace.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%6%%And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%7%%And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%8%%And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%9%%And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%10%%And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%11%%And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%12%%And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%13%%He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%14%%And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? And when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%15%%And when the sons of the prophets who were to view at Jericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%16%%And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%17%%And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%18%%And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%19%%And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the ground barren.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%20%%And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%21%%And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%22%%So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%23%%And he went up from thence to Beth-el: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald-head; go up, thou bald-head.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%24%%And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%2%%25%%And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%1%%Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%2%%And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%3%%Nevertheless, he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%4%%And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%5%%But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%6%%And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%7%%And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%8%%And he said, which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%9%%So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%10%%And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%11%%But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%12%%And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%13%%And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%14%%And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look towards thee, nor see thee.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%15%%But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%16%%And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%17%%For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%18%%And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%19%%And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%20%%And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat-offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%21%%And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%22%%And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%23%%And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%24%%And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%25%%And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirhara-seth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about it, and smote it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%26%%And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%3%%27%%Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: And they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%1%%Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and the creditor hath come to take to him my two sons to be bond-men.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%2%%And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%3%%Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%4%%And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%5%%So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%6%%And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%7%%Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the remainder.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%8%%And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a distinguished woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%9%%And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%10%%Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%11%%And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%12%%And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunamite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%13%%And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldst thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%14%%And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%15%%And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%16%%And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%17%%And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%18%%And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%19%%And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%20%%And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%21%%And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%22%%And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%23%%And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to-day? it is neither new-moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%24%%Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%25%%So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunamite:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%26%%Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with thee? Is it well with thy husband? Is it well with the child? and she answered, It is well.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%27%%And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is sorrowful within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%28%%Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%29%%Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet any man, salute him not; and if any shall salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%30%%And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%31%%And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%32%%And when Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%33%%He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them both, and prayed to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%34%%And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child became warm.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%35%%Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%36%%And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunamite. So he called her. And when she had come in to him, he said, Take up thy son.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%37%%Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%38%%And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%39%%And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered from it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%40%%So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%41%%But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%42%%And there came a man from Baal-shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in its husk. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%43%%And his servitor said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%4%%44%%So he set it before them, and they ate, and left of it, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%1%%Now Naaman, captain of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honorable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance to Syria: he was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%2%%And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%3%%And she said to her mistress, I would that my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%4%%And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%5%%And the king of Syria said, Come, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%6%%And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter hath come to thee, behold, I have with this sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%7%%And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send to me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%8%%And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%9%%So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%10%%And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%11%%But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%12%%Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%13%%And his servants came near, and spoke to him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldst thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%14%%Then he went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%15%%And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy servant.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%16%%But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%17%%And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice to other gods, but to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%18%%In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%19%%And he said to him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%20%%But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat from him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%21%%So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%22%%And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there have come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%23%%And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%24%%And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%25%%But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said to him, Whence comest thou Gehazi? and he said, Thy servant went no whither.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%26%%And he said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive-yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and maid-servants?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%5%%27%%The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%1%%And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too narrow for us.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%2%%Let us go, we pray thee, to Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%3%%And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%4%%So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%5%%But as one was felling a beam, the ax head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%6%%And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron floated.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%7%%Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%8%%Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%9%%And the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians have come down.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%10%%And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%11%%Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%12%%And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%13%%And he said, Go, and spy where he is, that I may send and bring him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%14%%Therefore he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and encompassed the city.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%15%%And when the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%16%%And he answered, Fear not: for they that are with us are more than they that are with them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%17%%And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%18%%And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%19%%And Elisha said to them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%20%%And it came to pass, when they had come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%21%%And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%22%%And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldst thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%23%%And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drank, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%24%%And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%25%%And there was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%26%%And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%27%%And he said, If the LORD doth not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barn-floor, or out of the wine-press?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%28%%And the king said to her, What aileth thee? and she answered, This woman said to me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%29%%So we boiled my son, and ate him: and I said to her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%30%%And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%31%%Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%32%%But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%6%%33%%And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is from the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%1%%Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To-morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%2%%Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%3%%And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%4%%If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall to the army of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%5%%And they rose in the twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they had come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%6%%For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%7%%Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%8%%And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drank, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%9%%Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%10%%So they came and called to the porter of the city: and they told him, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%11%%And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%12%%And the king arose in the night, and said to his servants, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp, to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%13%%And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%14%%They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%15%%And they went after them to Jordan: and lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%16%%And the people went out, and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%17%%And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%18%%And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%19%%And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thy eyes, but shalt not eat of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%7%%20%%And so it happened to him: for the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%1%%Then Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thy household, and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%2%%And the woman arose, and did according to the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%3%%And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned from the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry to the king for her house, and for her land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%4%%And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%5%%And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%6%%And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even till now.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%7%%And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told to him, saying, The man of God hath come hither.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%8%%And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%9%%So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-hadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%10%%And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou mayest certainly recover: but the LORD hath showed me, that he shall surely die.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%11%%And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%12%%And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%13%%And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shown me that thou wilt be king over Syria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%14%%So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%15%%And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%16%%And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%17%%Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%18%%And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%19%%Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him always a light, and to his children.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%20%%In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%21%%So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%22%%Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%23%%And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%24%%And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%25%%In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%26%%Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%27%%And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%28%%And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%8%%29%%And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%1%%And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thy hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%2%%And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%3%%Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%4%%So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%5%%And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us all? And he said, To thee, O captain.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%6%%And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%7%%And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%8%%For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab the males, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%9%%And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%10%%And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%11%%Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? Why came this mad man to thee? And he said to them, Ye know the man, and his communication.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%12%%And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%13%%Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%14%%So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%15%%But king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your minds, then let none go forth nor escape from the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%16%%So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%17%%And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%18%%So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he doth not return.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%19%%Then he sent out a second on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%20%%And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and doth not return? and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%21%%And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%22%%And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the lewd acts of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%23%%And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%24%%And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%25%%Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him into the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%26%%Surely I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%27%%But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%28%%And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%29%%And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%30%%And when Jehu had come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and adorned her head, and looked out at a window.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%31%%And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%32%%And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%33%%And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trod her under foot.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%34%%And when he had come in, he ate, and drank, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%35%%And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%36%%Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%9%%37%%And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%1%%And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%2%%Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%3%%Look out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%4%%But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%5%%And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thy eyes.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%6%%Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, if ye are mine, and if ye will hearken to my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to-morrow this time. Now the king's sons being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%7%%And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%8%%And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%9%%And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%10%%Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab; for the LORD hath done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%11%%So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsmen, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%12%%And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house in the way,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%13%%Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%14%%And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%15%%And when he had departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thy heart; And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%16%%And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%17%%And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%18%%And Jehu convened all the people, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%19%%Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal: whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%20%%And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%21%%And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%22%%And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%23%%And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshipers of Baal, Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshipers of Baal only.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%24%%And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%25%%And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%26%%And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%27%%And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught-house to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%28%%Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%29%%Yet from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%30%%And the LORD said to Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and hast done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%31%%But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%32%%In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%33%%From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%34%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%35%%And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%10%%36%%And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%1%%And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%2%%But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons who were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bed-chamber, from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%3%%And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah reigned over the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%4%%And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%5%%And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%6%%And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%7%%And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%8%%And ye shall compass the king around, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain. And be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%9%%And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%10%%And to the captains over hundreds the priest gave king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%11%%And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, around the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%12%%And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%13%%And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%14%%And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets. And Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, treason.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%15%%But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%16%%And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%17%%And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%18%%And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke wholly in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%19%%And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%20%%And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%11%%21%%Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%1%%In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%2%%And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%3%%But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%4%%And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, even the money of every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%5%%Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%6%%But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%7%%Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%8%%And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%9%%But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put in it all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%10%%And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and counted the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%11%%And they gave the money, being counted, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%12%%And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%13%%Yet, there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%14%%But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%15%%Moreover, they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%16%%The trespass-money and sin-money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%17%%Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%18%%And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%19%%And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%20%%And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%12%%21%%For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%1%%In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%2%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%3%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael, all their days.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%4%%And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened to him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%5%%(And the LORD gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as formerly.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%6%%Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked in them: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.)
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%7%%Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%8%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%9%%And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%10%%In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%11%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: but he walked in them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%12%%And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%13%%And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%14%%Now Elisha had fallen sick of his disease of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down to him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%15%%And Elisha said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to him bow and arrows.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%16%%And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%17%%And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou hast consumed them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%18%%And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and ceased.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%19%%And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%20%%And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%21%%And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulcher of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood on his feet.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%22%%But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%23%%And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he as yet reject them from his presence.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%24%%So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%13%%25%%And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash defeated him, and recovered the cities of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%1%%In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%2%%He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%3%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%4%%But, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people sacrificed, and burnt incense on the high places.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%5%%And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants who had slain the king his father.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%6%%But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, in which the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%7%%He slew of Edom in the valley of Salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%8%%Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%9%%And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%10%%Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldst thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldst fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%11%%But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up: and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%12%%And Judah was defeated before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%13%%And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%14%%And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%15%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%16%%And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%17%%And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%18%%And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%19%%Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%20%%And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%21%%And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%22%%He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%23%%In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%24%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%25%%He restored the border of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%26%%For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%27%%And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%28%%Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%14%%29%%And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%1%%In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%2%%Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%3%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%4%%Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%5%%And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%6%%And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%7%%So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%8%%In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%9%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%10%%And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%11%%And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%12%%This was the word of the LORD which he spoke to Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation. And so it came to pass.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%13%%Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%14%%For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%15%%And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%16%%Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were in it, and the borders of it from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women in it that were with child he ripped up.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%17%%In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%18%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%19%%And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%20%%And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%21%%And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%22%%And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%23%%In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%24%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%25%%But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%26%%And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%27%%In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%28%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%29%%In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%30%%And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%32%%In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%33%%Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%34%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%35%%Yet, the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%36%%Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%37%%In those days the LORD began to send against Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%15%%38%%And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: And Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%1%%In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%2%%Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%3%%But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and even made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%4%%And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%5%%Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%6%%At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and have dwelt there to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%7%%So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me from the hand of the king of Syria, and from the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%8%%And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%9%%And the king of Assyria hearkened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%10%%And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%11%%And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%12%%And when the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered on it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%13%%And he burnt his burnt-offering and his meat-offering, and poured his drink-offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offerings upon the altar.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%14%%And he brought also the brazen altar, which was before the LORD, from the front of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%15%%And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering, and the evening meat-offering, and the king's burnt-sacrifice, and his meat-offering, with the burnt-offering of all the people of the land, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%16%%Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%17%%And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%18%%And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, he turned from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%19%%Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%16%%20%%And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%1%%In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%2%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%3%%Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%4%%And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%5%%Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%6%%In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%7%%For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%8%%And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel which they had made.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%9%%And the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%10%%And they set up for themselves images and groves on every high hill, and under every green tree:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%11%%And there they burnt incense on all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%12%%For they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, Ye shall not do this thing.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%13%%Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%14%%Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%15%%And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were around them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%16%%And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made for themselves molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%17%%And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%18%%Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%19%%Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%20%%And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%21%%For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%22%%For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%23%%Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%24%%And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in its cities.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%25%%And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%26%%Wherefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%27%%Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%28%%Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%29%%Yet, every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they dwelt.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%30%%And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%31%%And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%32%%So they feared the LORD, and made to themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%33%%They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%34%%To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%35%%With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%36%%But the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an out-stretched arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%37%%And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%38%%And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%39%%But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%40%%Yet they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%17%%41%%So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%1%%Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%2%%Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%3%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%4%%He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for till those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%5%%He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%6%%For he cleaved to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%7%%And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%8%%He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and its borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%9%%And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%10%%And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%11%%And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%12%%Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%13%%Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah, and took them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%14%%And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me I will bear. And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%15%%And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%16%%At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%17%%And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great army against Jerusalem: and they went up, and came to Jerusalem: and when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%18%%And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%19%%And Rab-shakeh said to them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou trustest?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%20%%Thou sayest, but they are but vain words, I have counsel and strength for the war. Now in whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%21%%Now behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leaneth, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%22%%But if ye say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%23%%Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou shalt be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%24%%How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%25%%Have I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%26%%Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah, to Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%27%%But Rab-shakeh said to them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may feed on their vilest excretions with you?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%28%%Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews language, and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%29%%Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%30%%Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%31%%Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%32%%Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-oil and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not to Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%33%%Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%34%%Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%35%%Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%36%%But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%18%%37%%Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rab-shakeh.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%1%%And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%2%%And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%3%%And they said to him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%4%%It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%5%%So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%6%%And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%7%%Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%8%%So Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%9%%And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Cush, Behold, he hath come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%10%%Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%11%%Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%12%%Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden who were in Thelasar?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%13%%Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%14%%And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%15%%And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%16%%LORD, bow down thy ear, and hear: open, LORD, thy eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent him to reproach the living God.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%17%%Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%18%%And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%19%%Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%20%%Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%21%%This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%22%%Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high: even against the Holy One of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%23%%By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the hight of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down its tall cedar trees, and its choice fir trees: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%24%%I have digged and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%25%%Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldst be to lay waste fortified cities in ruinous heaps.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%26%%Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house-tops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%27%%But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%28%%Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%29%%And this shall be a sign to thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%30%%And the remnant that hath escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%31%%For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape from mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%32%%Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%33%%By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%34%%For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%35%%And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%36%%So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%19%%37%%And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%1%%In those days was Hezekiah sick to death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%2%%Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%3%%I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept grievously.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%4%%And it came to pass, before Isaiah had gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%5%%Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%6%%And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%7%%And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%8%%And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%9%%And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%10%%And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten degrees: no, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%11%%And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%12%%At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%13%%And Hezekiah hearkened to them, and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%14%%Then came Isaiah the prophet to king Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and from whence came they to thee? And Hezekiah said, They have come from a far country even from Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%15%%And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%16%%And Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%17%%Behold, the days come, that all that is in thy house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store to this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%18%%And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%19%%Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth shall be in my days?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%20%%And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%20%%21%%And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%1%%Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzi-bah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%2%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%3%%For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%4%%And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%5%%And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%6%%And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he committed much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%7%%And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%8%%Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%9%%But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%10%%And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%11%%Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, who were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%12%%Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%13%%And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%14%%And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%15%%Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%16%%Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing evil in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%17%%Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%18%%And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%19%%Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%20%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%21%%And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshiped them:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%22%%And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%23%%And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%24%%And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%25%%Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%21%%26%%And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%1%%Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%2%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%3%%And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%4%%Go to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered from the people:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%5%%And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work, which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%6%%To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber, and hewn stone to repair the house.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%7%%But there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%8%%And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%9%%And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%10%%And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%11%%And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%12%%And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%13%%Go ye, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%14%%So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%15%%And she said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%16%%Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%17%%Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%18%%But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, concerning the words which thou hast heard;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%19%%Because thy heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%22%%20%%Behold therefore, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thy eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%1%%And the king sent, and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%2%%And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%3%%And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%4%%And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Beth-el.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%5%%And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%6%%And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder of it upon the graves of the children of the people.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%7%%And he broke down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%8%%And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beer-sheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%9%%Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%10%%And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%11%%And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%12%%And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%13%%And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%14%%And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%15%%Moreover, the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%16%%And as Josiah turned himself, he espied the sepulchers that were there on the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchers, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%17%%Then he said, What title is that which I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%18%%And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%19%%And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the LORD to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Beth-el.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%20%%And he slew all the priests of the high places, that were there upon the altars, and burnt men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%21%%And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%22%%Surely there was not held such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%23%%But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, in which this passover was held to the LORD in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%24%%Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%25%%And like him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%26%%Notwithstanding, the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%27%%And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%28%%Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%29%%In his days Pharaoh-nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%30%%And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%31%%Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%32%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%33%%And Pharaoh-nechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and subjected the land to a tribute of a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%34%%And Pharaoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt and died there.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%35%%And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, from every one according to his taxation, to give it to Pharaoh-nechoh.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%36%%Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%23%%37%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%1%%In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%2%%And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%3%%Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%4%%And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%5%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%6%%So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%7%%And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%8%%Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%9%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%10%%At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%11%%And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%12%%And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%13%%And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%14%%And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the artificers, and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%15%%And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%16%%And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and artificers and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%17%%And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%18%%Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%19%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%24%%20%%For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%1%%And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it on all sides.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%2%%And the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%3%%And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%4%%And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city on all sides:) and the king went the way towards the plain.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%5%%And the army of the Chaldees pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%6%%So they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%7%%And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%8%%And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%9%%And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house he burnt with fire.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%10%%And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem on all sides.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%11%%Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carry away.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%12%%But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vine-dressers and husbandmen.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%13%%And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%14%%And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%15%%And the fire-pans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%16%%The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%17%%The hight of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the capital upon it was brass: and the hight of the capital three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the capital around, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with wreathen work.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%18%%And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%19%%And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%20%%And Nebuzar-adan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%21%%And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%22%%And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%23%%And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of Maachathite, they and their men.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%24%%And Gedaliah swore to them, and to their men, and said to them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%25%%But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%26%%And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%27%%And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%28%%And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%29%%And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
1000005%%2 Kings%%OT%%25%%30%%And his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%21%%And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%22%%All these who were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their set office.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%23%%So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%24%%In four quarters were the porters, towards the east, west, north and south.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%25%%And their brethren, who were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%26%%For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%27%%And they lodged about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening of it every morning pertained to them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%28%%And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by number.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%29%%Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%30%%And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%31%%And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the first-born of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%32%%And others of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the show-bread, to prepare it every sabbath.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%33%%And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%34%%These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%35%%And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was Maachah:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%36%%And his first-born son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%37%%And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%38%%And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%39%%And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%40%%And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat Micah.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%41%%And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%42%%And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%43%%And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%44%%And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%1%%Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%2%%And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%3%%And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%4%%Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%5%%And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%6%%So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%7%%And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%8%%And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%9%%And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%10%%And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%11%%And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%12%%They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%13%%So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%14%%And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%1%%Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%2%%And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%3%%Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%4%%And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%5%%And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%6%%And David said, Whoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was chief.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%7%%And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it, The city of David.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%8%%And he built the city around, even from Millo around: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%9%%So David became greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%10%%These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%11%%And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam a Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%12%%And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%13%%He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%14%%And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%15%%Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%16%%And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Beth-lehem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%17%%And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that is at the gate!
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%18%%And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%19%%And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%20%%And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%21%%Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: but he attained not to the first three.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%22%%Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion-like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%23%%And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%24%%These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%25%%Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%1%%And David consulted with the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and with every leader.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%2%%And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If it seemeth good to you, and that it is of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites who are in their cities and suburbs, that they may assemble to us:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%3%%And let us bring again to us the ark of our God: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%4%%And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%5%%So David assembled all Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%6%%And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%7%%And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%8%%And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%9%%And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%10%%And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%11%%And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%12%%And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%13%%So David brought not the ark to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%14%%And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%1%%Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.

1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%3%%And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%4%%Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%9%%And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%10%%And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thy hand.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%11%%So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%12%%And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%13%%And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%14%%Therefore David inquired again of God: and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%15%%And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt go out to battle: for God hath gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%16%%David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%17%%And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%1%%And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%2%%Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%3%%And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%4%%And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%5%%Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%6%%Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%7%%Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%8%%Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%9%%Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren eighty:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%10%%Of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%11%%And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%12%%And said to them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%13%%For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%14%%So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%15%%And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staffs on it, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%16%%And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%17%%So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%18%%And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%19%%So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%20%%And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%21%%And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%22%%And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%23%%And Berechiah and Elkanah were door-keepers for the ark.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%24%%And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were door-keepers for the ark.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%25%%So David and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom with joy.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%26%%And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%27%%And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%28%%Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%29%%And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, looking out at a window, saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%1%%So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-sacrifices and peace-offerings before God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%2%%And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%3%%And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%4%%And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%5%%Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%6%%Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%7%%Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%8%%Give thanks to the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%9%%Sing to him, sing psalms to him, talk ye of all his wonderous works.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%10%%Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%11%%Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%12%%Remember his wonderful works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%13%%O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%14%%He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%15%%Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%16%%Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath to Isaac;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%17%%And which he confirmed to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%18%%Saying, To thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%19%%When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%20%%And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%21%%He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%22%%Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%23%%Sing to the LORD, all the earth; show forth from day to day his salvation.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%24%%Declare his glory among the heathen; his wonderful works among all nations.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%25%%For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%26%%For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%27%%Glory and honor are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%28%%Give to the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%29%%Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%30%%Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%31%%Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%32%%Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%33%%Then shall the trees of the wood sing at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%34%%O give thanks to the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%35%%And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%36%%Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%37%%So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%38%%And Obed-edom with their brethren, sixty and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%39%%And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%40%%To offer burnt-offerings to the LORD upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%41%%And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%42%%And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%43%%And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%1%%Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%2%%Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%3%%And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%4%%Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%5%%For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%6%%Wherever I have walked with all Israel, have I spoken a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%7%%Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldst be ruler over my people Israel:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%8%%And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%9%%Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%10%%And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all thy enemies. Furthermore, I tell thee that the LORD will build thee a house.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%11%%And it shall come to pass, when thy days shall be ended that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%12%%He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%13%%I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%14%%But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%15%%According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%16%%And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%17%%And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%18%%What can David speak more to thee for the honor of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%19%%O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%20%%O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%21%%And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%22%%For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%23%%Therefore now, LORD, Let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%24%%Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%25%%For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%26%%And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness to thy servant:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%27%%Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%1%%Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%2%%And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%3%%And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%4%%And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot-horses, but reserved of them a hundred chariots.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%5%%And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%6%%Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%7%%And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%8%%Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David brought very much brass, with which Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%9%%Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%10%%He sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had warred with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold, and silver, and brass.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%11%%Them also king David dedicated to the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%12%%Moreover, Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%13%%And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%14%%So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%15%%And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%16%%And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%17%%And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%1%%Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%2%%And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%3%%But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, that he hath sent comforters to thee? are not his servants come to thee to search, and to overthrow, and to explore the land?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%4%%Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%5%%Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%6%%And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%7%%So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon assembled from their cities, and came to battle.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%8%%And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%9%%And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that had come were by themselves in the field.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%10%%Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he selected all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%11%%And the rest of the people he delivered to the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%12%%And he said, If the Syrians shall be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon shall be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%13%%Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%14%%So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%15%%And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%16%%And when the Syrians saw that they were defeated before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%17%%And it was told to David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%18%%But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men who fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%19%%And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%1%%And it came to pass, that after the year had expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%2%%And David took the crown of their king from his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also a great quantity of spoil out of the city.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%3%%And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%4%%And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%5%%And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear-staff was like a weaver's beam.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%6%%And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%7%%But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%8%%These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%1%%And Satan stood up against Israel, and incited David to number Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%2%%And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%3%%And Joab answered, the LORD make his people a hundred times more numerous than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%4%%Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%5%%And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%6%%But Levi and Benjamin he counted not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%7%%And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%8%%And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%9%%And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%10%%Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it to thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%11%%So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%12%%Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while the sword of thy enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%13%%And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%14%%So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%15%%And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thy hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%16%%And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%17%%And David said to God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be afflicted.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%18%%Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and erect an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%19%%And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%20%%And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%21%%And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked, and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%22%%Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build an altar in it to the LORD: thou shalt grant it to me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%23%%And Ornan said to David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat-offering; I give it all.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%24%%And king David said to Ornan, No; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt-offerings without cost.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%25%%So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%26%%And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%27%%And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%28%%At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%29%%For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt-offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%30%%But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%1%%Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%2%%And David commanded to assemble the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%3%%And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%4%%Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%5%%And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the LORD must be very magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David made abundant preparation before his death.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%6%%Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%7%%And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build a house to the name of the LORD my God:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%8%%But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house to my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%9%%Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies around: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%10%%He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%11%%Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%12%%Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%13%%Then shalt thou prosper, if thou shalt take heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%14%%Now behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add to them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%15%%Moreover, there are workmen with thee in great numbers, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of skillful men for every manner of work.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%16%%Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%17%%David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%18%%Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%19%%Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise, therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%1%%So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%2%%And he assembled all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%3%%Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%4%%Of which, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%5%%Moreover, four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise with them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%6%%And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%7%%Of the Gershonites, were, Laadan and Shimei.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%8%%The sons of Laadan: the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%9%%The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%10%%And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%11%%And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%12%%The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%13%%The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister to him, and to bless in his name for ever.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%14%%Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%15%%The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%16%%Of the sons of Gershom; Shebuel was the chief.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%17%%And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%18%%Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%19%%Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jehaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%20%%Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%21%%The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%22%%And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%23%%The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%24%%These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%25%%For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest to his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%26%%And also to the Levites: they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its service.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%27%%For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%28%%Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%29%%Both for the show-bread, and for the fine flour for meat-offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%30%%And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at evening;
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%31%%And to offer all burnt-sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded to them, continually before the LORD:
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%32%%And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%1%%Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%2%%But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests' office.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%3%%And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%4%%And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%5%%Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
1000005%%1 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%6%%And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%2%%Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%3%%So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon: for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%4%%But the ark of God David had brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.

1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%8%%And Solomon said to God, Thou hast shown great mercy to David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%9%%Now, O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%10%%Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy great people?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%11%%And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%12%%Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%13%%Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%14%%And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%15%%And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%16%%And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%1%%17%%And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and so they brought out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%1%%And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%2%%And Solomon numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%3%%And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in it, even so deal with me.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%4%%Behold, I build a house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show-bread, and for the burnt-offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%5%%And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all gods.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%6%%But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then that I should build him a house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?

1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%8%%Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants have skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%9%%Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderfully great.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%10%%And behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%11%%Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%12%%Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that may build a house for the LORD, and a house for his kingdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%13%%And now I have sent a skillful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,

1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%17%%And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%2%%18%%And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%1%%Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the LORD appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%2%%And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%3%%Now these are the things in which Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%4%%And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the hight was a hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%5%%And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm trees and chains.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%6%%And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%7%%He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%8%%And he made the most holy house, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%9%%And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%10%%And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and overlaid them with gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%11%%And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%12%%And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%13%%The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%14%%And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim upon it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%15%%Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%16%%And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%3%%17%%And he erected the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%1%%Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the hight of it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%2%%Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the hight of it; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%3%%And under it was the similitude of oxen, which encompassed it: ten in a cubit, encompassing the sea. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%4%%It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%5%%And the thickness of it was a hand-breadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held three thousand baths.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%6%%He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt-offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%7%%And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%8%%He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%9%%Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%10%%And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%11%%And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%12%%To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%13%%And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were upon the pillars.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%14%%He made also bases, and lavers he made upon the bases;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%15%%One sea, and twelve oxen under it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%16%%The pots also, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%17%%In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%18%%Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be ascertained.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%19%%And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables on which the show-bread was set;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%20%%Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%21%%And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%4%%22%%And the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%1%%Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, he put among the treasures of the house of God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%2%%Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the city of David, which is Zion.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%3%%Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%4%%And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%5%%And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%6%%Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%7%%And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%8%%For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark, and the staffs of it above.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%9%%And they drew out the staffs of the ark, that the ends of the staffs were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is to this day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%10%%There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put in it at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%11%%And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%12%%Also the Levites who were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren; being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%13%%It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%5%%14%%So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%1%%Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%2%%But I have built a house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%3%%And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%4%%And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spoke with his mouth to my father David, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%5%%Since the day that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%6%%But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%7%%Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD God of Israel:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%8%%But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thy heart;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%9%%Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%10%%The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken; for I am raised up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%11%%And in it have I put the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%12%%And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%13%%(For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heaven,)
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%14%%And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the heaven, nor on the earth; who keepest covenant, and showest mercy to thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%15%%Thou who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and hast spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%16%%Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; provided thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%17%%Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%18%%But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%19%%Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken to the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%20%%That thy eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which thou hast said, that thou wouldst put thy name there; to hearken to the prayer which thy servant prayeth towards this place.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%21%%Hearken therefore to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make towards this place: hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%22%%If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath shall come before thy altar in this house;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%23%%Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%24%%And if thy people Israel shall be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%25%%Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%26%%When the heaven is shut, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray towards this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%27%%Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%28%%If there shall be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies shall besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever calamity, or whatever sickness there be:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%29%%Then whatever prayer, or whatever supplication shall be made by any man, or by all the people of Israel, when every one shall know his own calamity, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%30%%Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%31%%That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest to our fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%32%%Moreover concerning the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but hath come from a distant country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy out-stretched arm; if they come and pray in this house;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%33%%Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%34%%If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray to thee towards this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%35%%Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%36%%If they sin against thee, (for there is no man who sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives to a land far off or near;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%37%%Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%38%%If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray towards their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and towards the city which thou hast chosen, and towards the house which I have built for thy name:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%39%%Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%40%%Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thy eyes be open, and let thy ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%41%%Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%6%%42%%O LORD God, turn not away the face of thy anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%1%%Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%2%%And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%3%%And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%4%%Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%5%%And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%6%%And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%7%%Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings, and the meat-offerings, and the fat.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%8%%Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entrance of Hamath to the river of Egypt.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%9%%And on the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%10%%And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%11%%Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%12%%And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%13%%If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%14%%If my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%15%%Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%16%%For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%17%%And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%18%%Then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%19%%But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%20%%Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a by-word among all nations.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%21%%And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%7%%22%%And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%1%%And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%2%%That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%3%%And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%4%%And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%5%%Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%6%%And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%7%%As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%8%%But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%9%%But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%10%%And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%11%%And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, to which the ark of the LORD hath come.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%12%%Then Solomon offered burnt-offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%13%%Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%14%%And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%15%%And they departed not from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%16%%Now all the work of Solomon was prepared to the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%17%%Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%8%%18%%And Huram sent to him by the hands of his servants, ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%1%%And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she had come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%2%%And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%3%%And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%4%%And the provisions of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cup-bearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%5%%And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in my own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%6%%Yet, I believed not their words, until I came, and my eyes had seen it: and behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told to me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%7%%Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%8%%Blessed be the LORD thy God, who delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%9%%And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%10%%And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%11%%And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%12%%And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%13%%Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%14%%Besides that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%15%%And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%16%%And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%17%%Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%18%%And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting-place, and two lions standing by the stays:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%19%%And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%20%%And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%21%%For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: once every three years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%22%%And king Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%23%%And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%24%%And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%25%%And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%26%%And he reigned over all the kings from the river even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%27%%And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees he made as the sycamore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%28%%And they brought to Solomon horses from Egypt, and from all lands.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%29%%Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%30%%And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%9%%31%%And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%1%%And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem had all Israel come to make him king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%2%%And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%3%%And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%4%%Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%5%%And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%6%%And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%7%%And they spoke to him, saying, If thou wilt be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%8%%But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%9%%And he said to them, What advice give ye, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father put upon us?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%10%%And the young men that were brought up with him, spoke to him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%11%%For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%12%%So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king directed, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%13%%And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%14%%And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%15%%So the king hearkened not to the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spoke by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%16%%And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have no inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thy own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%17%%But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%18%%Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get into his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%10%%19%%And Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%1%%And when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%2%%But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%3%%Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%4%%Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done by me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%5%%And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%6%%He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%7%%And Beth-zur, and Shocho, and Adullam,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%8%%And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%9%%And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%10%%And Zorah, and Ajalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%11%%And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of provisions, and of oil and wine.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%12%%And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%13%%And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him from all their borders.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%14%%For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office to the LORD:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%15%%And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%16%%And after them out of all the tribes of Israel, such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice to the LORD God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%17%%So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%18%%And Rehoboam took to himself Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David for a wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%19%%Who bore him children, Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%20%%And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; who bore him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%21%%And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and sixty concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and sixty daughters.)
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%22%%And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%11%%23%%And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city: and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he desired many wives.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%1%%And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%2%%And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%3%%With twelve hundred chariots, and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Cushites.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%4%%And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%5%%Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were assembled at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%6%%Upon which the princes of Israel, and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%7%%And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%8%%Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%9%%So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%10%%Instead of which, king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%11%%And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and conveyed them, and brought them again into the guard-chamber.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%12%%And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%13%%So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%14%%And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%15%%Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer, concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%12%%16%%And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%1%%Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%2%%He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%3%%And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valor.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%4%%And Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%5%%Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%6%%Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat the servant of Solomon the son of David, hath risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%7%%And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and they have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%8%%And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%9%%Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made for you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%10%%But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, who minister to the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%11%%And they burn to the LORD every morning and every evening burnt-sacrifices and sweet incense: the show-bread also they set in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%12%%And behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye will not prosper.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%13%%But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%14%%And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried to the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%15%%Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%16%%And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%17%%And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%18%%Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%19%%And Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%20%%Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%21%%But Abijah became mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%13%%22%%And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%1%%So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%2%%And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%3%%For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%4%%And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%5%%Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%6%%And he built fortified cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%7%%Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built, and prospered.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%8%%And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%9%%And there came out against them Zerah the Cushite, with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%10%%Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathath at Mareshah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%11%%And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%12%%So the LORD smote the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%13%%And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Cushites were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%14%%And they smote all the cities about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they plundered all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%14%%15%%They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%1%%And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%2%%And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%3%%Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%4%%But when they in their trouble returned to the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%5%%And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%6%%And nation was destroyed by nation, and city by city: for God troubled them with all adversity.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%7%%Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak; for your work shall be rewarded.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%8%%And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%9%%And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they resorted to him out of Israel in multitudes, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%10%%So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%11%%And they offered to the LORD at the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%12%%And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%13%%That whoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%14%%And they swore to the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%15%%And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them: and the LORD gave them rest on all sides.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%16%%And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%17%%But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%18%%And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%15%%19%%And there was no more war until the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%1%%In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%2%%Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%3%%There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%4%%And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%5%%And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off the building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%6%%Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha was building, and he built with it Geba and Mizpah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%7%%And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore hath the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%8%%Were not the Cushites and the Lubims a numerous army, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thy hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%9%%For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him. In this thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%10%%Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%11%%And behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%12%%And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceedingly severe: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%13%%And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%16%%14%%And they buried him in his own sepulchers which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%1%%And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%2%%And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%3%%And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%4%%But sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%5%%Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand: and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%6%%And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%7%%Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%8%%And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%9%%And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%10%%And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%11%%Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%12%%And Jehoshaphat became exceedingly great; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%13%%And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%14%%And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%15%%And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%16%%And next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%17%%And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%18%%And next to him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for the war.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%17%%19%%These waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%1%%Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%2%%And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%3%%And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%4%%And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to-day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%5%%Therefore the king of Israel collected of prophets four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%6%%But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%7%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good to me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%8%%And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%9%%And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat each of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%10%%And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they shall be consumed.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%11%%And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%12%%And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one consent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%13%%And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%14%%And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%15%%And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%16%%Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%17%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good to me, but evil?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%18%%Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%19%%And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%20%%Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said to him, With what?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%21%%And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the LORD said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out and do even so.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%22%%Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%23%%Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the spirit of the LORD from me to speak to thee?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%24%%And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%25%%Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%26%%And say, Thus saith the king, Put this man in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%27%%And Micaiah said, If thou shalt certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%28%%So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%29%%And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%30%%Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%31%%And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%32%%For it came to pass, that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%33%%And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot-man, Turn thy hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%18%%34%%And the battle increased that day: yet the king of Israel supported himself in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening: and about the time of the sun setting he died.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%1%%And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%2%%And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%3%%Nevertheless, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%4%%And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to the LORD God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%5%%And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%6%%And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%7%%Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%8%%Moreover, in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%9%%And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%10%%And whatever cause shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%19%%11%%And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD will be with the good.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%1%%It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them others besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%2%%Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of Syria; and behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%3%%And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%4%%And Judah assembled, to ask help of the LORD: even from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%5%%And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%6%%And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest thou not over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thy hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%7%%Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%8%%And they dwelt in it, and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%9%%If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry to thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%10%%And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldst not let Israel invade, when they came from the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%11%%Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%12%%O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%13%%And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%14%%Then upon Jehaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%15%%And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD to you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%16%%To-morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%17%%Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to-morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%18%%And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshiping the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%19%%And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%20%%And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%21%%And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%22%%And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, who were come against Judah; and they were smitten.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%23%%For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%24%%And when Judah came towards the watch-tower in the wilderness, they looked to the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%25%%And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering the spoil, it was so much.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%26%%And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place hath been called, The valley of Berachah, to this day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%27%%Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%28%%And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%29%%And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%30%%So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest on all sides.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%31%%And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%32%%And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%33%%But the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts to the God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%34%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%35%%And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%36%%And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%20%%37%%Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%1%%Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%2%%And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%3%%And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram; because he was the first-born.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%4%%Now when Jehoram had risen to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%5%%Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%6%%And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab for a wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%7%%Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%8%%In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%9%%Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites who encompassed him, and the captains of the chariots.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%10%%So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%11%%Moreover, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah to do the same.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%12%%And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%13%%But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit idolatry, like the idolatries of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, who were better than thyself:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%14%%Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%15%%And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%16%%Moreover, the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Cushites.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%17%%And they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was not a son left to him, save Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%18%%And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%19%%And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%21%%20%%Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem, eight years, and departed without being desired: yet they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%1%%And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%2%%Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%3%%He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%4%%Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counselors, after the death of his father, to his destruction.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%5%%He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%6%%And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%7%%And the destruction of Ahaziah was from God by coming to Joram: for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%8%%And it came to pass, that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%9%%And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to retain the kingdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%10%%But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose, and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%11%%But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bed chamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%22%%12%%And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%1%%And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%2%%And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%3%%And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%4%%This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests, and of the Levites, shall be porters of the doors;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%5%%And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%6%%But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%7%%And the Levites shall encompass the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%8%%So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%9%%Moreover, Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds, spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%10%%And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king on all sides.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%11%%Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%12%%Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%13%%And she looked, and behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%14%%Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said to them, Have her forth without the ranges: and whoever followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%15%%So they laid hands on her; and when she had come to the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%16%%And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%17%%Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%18%%Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt-offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%19%%And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none who was unclean in any thing should enter.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%20%%And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%23%%21%%And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%1%%Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%2%%And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%3%%And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%4%%And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%5%%And he convened the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather from all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. But the Levites hastened it not.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%6%%And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%7%%For the sons of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD they bestowed upon Baalim.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%8%%And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%9%%And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%10%%And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%11%%Now it came to pass, that at the time the chest was brought to the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and collected money in abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%12%%And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%13%%So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in its state, and strengthened it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%14%%And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer with, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt-offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%15%%But Jehoiada grew old, and was full of days when he died; a hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%16%%And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his house.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%17%%Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%18%%And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%19%%Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again to the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%20%%And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood above the people, and said to them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%21%%And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%22%%Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%23%%And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the army of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%24%%For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%25%%And when they had departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%26%%And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%24%%27%%Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%1%%Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%2%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%3%%Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%4%%But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law of the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%5%%Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%6%%He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%7%%But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%8%%But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God will make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%9%%And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%10%%Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%11%%And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%12%%And other ten thousand left alive the children of Judah carried away captive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they were all broken in pieces.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%13%%But the soldiers of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%14%%Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed himself before them, and burned incense to them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%15%%Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%16%%And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, Art thou made of the king's council? forbear? why shouldst thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbore, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened to my counsel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%17%%Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%18%%And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son for a wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%19%%Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thy heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldst thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldst fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%20%%But Amaziah would not hear; for it came from God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%21%%So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%22%%And Judah was defeated before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%23%%And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%24%%And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%25%%And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, fifteen years.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%26%%Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%27%%Now after the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%25%%28%%And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%1%%Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%2%%He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%3%%Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%4%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%5%%And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and, as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%6%%And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%7%%And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%8%%And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt: for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%9%%Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%10%%Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had many cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine-dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%11%%Moreover, Uzziah had an army of fighting men, that went out to war, by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%12%%The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valor were two thousand and six hundred.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%13%%And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%14%%And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%15%%And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name spread far abroad; for he was helped in a wonderful manner, till he was strong.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%16%%But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%17%%And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%18%%And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It appertaineth not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither will it be for thy honor from the LORD God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%19%%Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%20%%And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests looked upon him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%21%%And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%22%%Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were written by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amos.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%26%%23%%So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%1%%Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%2%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: yet, he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%3%%He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%4%%Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%5%%He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay to him, both the second year, and the third.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%6%%So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%7%%Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, see, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%8%%He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%27%%9%%And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%1%%Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%2%%For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%3%%Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%4%%He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%5%%Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%6%%For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day, who were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%7%%And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%8%%And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%9%%But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth to heaven.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%10%%And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bond-men and bond-women to you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%11%%Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%12%%Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%13%%And said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%14%%So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%15%%And the men who were expressed by name arose, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%16%%At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%17%%For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%18%%The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with its villages, and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages: and they dwelt there.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%19%%For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel: for he made Judah naked, and greatly transgressed against the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%20%%And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%21%%For Ahaz took away a portion from the house of the LORD, and from the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%22%%And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%23%%For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%24%%And Ahaz collected the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%25%%And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%26%%Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%28%%27%%And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%1%%Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%2%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%3%%He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%4%%And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and assembled them in the east street,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%5%%And said to them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%6%%For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%7%%Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%8%%Wherefore the wrath of the LORD hath been upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%9%%For lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%10%%Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%11%%My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister to him, and burn incense.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%12%%Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%13%%And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%14%%And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%15%%And they assembled their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%16%%And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%17%%Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%18%%Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all its vessels, and the show-bread table, with all its vessels.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%19%%Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%20%%Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and convened the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%21%%And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%22%%So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%23%%And they brought forth the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%24%%And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%25%%And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%26%%And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%27%%And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar. And when the burnt-offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%28%%And all the congregation worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%29%%And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshiped.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%30%%Moreover, Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to the LORD, with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%31%%Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and, as many as were of a free heart, burnt-offerings.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%32%%And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams: and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%33%%And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%34%%But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites helped them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%35%%And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%29%%36%%And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%1%%And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%2%%For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%3%%For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people assembled themselves at Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%4%%And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%5%%So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover to the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in the manner as it was written.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%6%%So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you that have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%7%%And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%8%%Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%9%%For if ye turn again to the LORD, your brethren and your children will find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they will return into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%10%%So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even to Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%11%%Nevertheless, divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%12%%Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%13%%And there assembled at Jerusalem many people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%14%%And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%15%%Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt-offerings into the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%16%%And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%17%%For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%18%%For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%19%%That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%20%%And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%21%%And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments to the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%22%%And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%23%%And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%24%%For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%25%%And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came from the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%26%%So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%30%%27%%Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer ascended to his holy dwelling-place, even to heaven.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%1%%Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%2%%And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%3%%He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt-offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt-offerings, and the burnt-offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new-moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%4%%Moreover, he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%5%%And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first-fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things they brought in abundantly.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%6%%And the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%7%%In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%8%%And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%9%%Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%10%%And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%11%%Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%12%%And brought in the offerings and the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Conaniah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%13%%And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%14%%And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter towards the east, was over the free-will-offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%15%%And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%16%%Besides their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even to every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%17%%Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges, by their courses;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%18%%And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%19%%Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%20%%And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and performed that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%31%%21%%And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%1%%After these things, and their establishment, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%2%%And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%3%%He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they helped him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%4%%So there were assembled many people, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%5%%Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%6%%And he set captains of war over the people, and assembled them to him in the street of the gate of the city, and encouraged them, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%7%%Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there are more with us than with him:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%8%%With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%9%%After this Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%10%%Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, On what do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%11%%Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%12%%Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%13%%Know ye not what I and my fathers have done to all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of my hand?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%14%%Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%15%%Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you in this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom hath been able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%16%%And his servants spoke yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%17%%He wrote also letters to rail at the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%18%%Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to fill them with consternation; that they might take the city.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%19%%And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, the work of the hands of man.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%20%%And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%21%%And the LORD sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he had come into the house of his god, they that came forth from his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%22%%Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%23%%And many brought gifts to the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that from thenceforth he was magnified in the sight of all nations.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%24%%In those days Hezekiah was sick and near to death, and he prayed to the LORD: and he spoke to him, and he gave him a sign.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%25%%But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%26%%Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%27%%And Hezekiah had very great riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%28%%Store-houses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%29%%Moreover, he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance in great abundance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%30%%This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%31%%But, in the business of the embassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%32%%Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%32%%33%%And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%1%%Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%2%%But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%3%%For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%4%%Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%5%%And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%6%%And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%7%%And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%8%%Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; provided they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%9%%So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%10%%And the LORD spoke to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%11%%Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%12%%And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%13%%And prayed to him: and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he is God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%14%%Now after this, he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish-gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great highth, and put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%15%%And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%16%%And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%17%%Nevertheless, the people sacrificed still in the high places, yet to the LORD their God only.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%18%%Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%19%%His prayer also, and how God was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%20%%So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%21%%Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%22%%But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed to all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%23%%And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%24%%And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%33%%25%%But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%1%%Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%2%%And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%3%%For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%4%%And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them and strewed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%5%%And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%6%%And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, with their mattocks around.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%7%%And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%8%%Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%9%%And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had collected from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%10%%And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and mend the house:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%11%%Even to the artificers and builders they gave it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%12%%And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to superintend it; and others of the Levites, all that had skill in instruments of music.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%13%%Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%14%%And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD given by Moses.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%15%%And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%16%%And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they perform.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%17%%And they have collected the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%18%%Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%19%%And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%20%%And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%21%%Go, inquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel, and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%22%%And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%23%%And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%24%%Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%25%%Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%26%%And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, so shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%27%%Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou didst hear his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and didst humble thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%28%%Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%29%%Then the king sent and convened all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%30%%And the king went into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%31%%And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%32%%And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin, to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%34%%33%%And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel, to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%1%%Moreover, Josiah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%2%%And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%3%%And said to the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy to the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%4%%And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%5%%And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%6%%So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%7%%And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover-offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%8%%And his princes gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%9%%Conaniah also, and Shemaiah, and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jehiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover-offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%10%%So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%11%%And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%12%%And they removed the burnt-offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%13%%And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%14%%And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering burnt-offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%15%%And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%16%%So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt-offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%17%%And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%18%%And there was no passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%19%%In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%20%%After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%21%%But he sent embassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he may not destroy thee.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%22%%Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself that he might fight with him, and hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%23%%And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am severely wounded.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%24%%His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%25%%And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women have spoken of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and behold, they are written in the lamentations.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%26%%Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%35%%27%%And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%1%%Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%2%%Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%3%%And the king of Egypt deposed him at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%4%%And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%5%%Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%6%%Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%7%%Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%8%%Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%9%%Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%12%%And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%13%%And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%14%%Moreover, all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%15%%And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling-place:
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%16%%But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%17%%Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%18%%And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%19%%And they burnt the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its goodly vessels.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%20%%And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%21%%To fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.
1000005%%2 Chronicles%%OT%%36%%22%%Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%59%%And these were they who went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not show their fathers' house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%60%%The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%61%%And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai: who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%62%%These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%63%%And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%64%%The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and sixty,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%65%%Besides their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing-men and singing-women.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%66%%Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%67%%Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%68%%And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in its place:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%69%%They gave after their ability to the treasure of the work sixty and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pounds of silver, and one hundred priests garments.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%2%%70%%So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%1%%And when the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people assembled themselves as one man at Jerusalem.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%2%%Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt-offerings on it as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%3%%And they set the altar upon its bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt-offerings on it to the LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%4%%They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt-offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%5%%And afterward offered the continual burnt-offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a free-will-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%6%%From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%7%%They gave money also to the masons, and to the carpenters; and provisions, and drink, and oil, to them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%8%%Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%9%%Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%10%%And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%11%%And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks to the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever towards Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%12%%But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, old men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%3%%13%%So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%1%%Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building the temple to the LORD God of Israel;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%2%%Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assur, who brought us up hither.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%3%%But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%4%%Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%5%%And hired counselors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%6%%And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%7%%And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions to Artaxerxes king of Persia, and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian language, and interpreted in the Syrian language.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%8%%Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%9%%Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dianites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%10%%And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side of the river, and at such a time.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%11%%This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him, even to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men on this side of the river, and at such a time.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%12%%Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came from thee to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the noxious city, and have set up its walls, and joined the foundations.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%13%%Be it known now to the king, that, if this city shall be built, and the walls set up again, then they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou wilt endamage the revenue of the kings.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%14%%Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%15%%That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so wilt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%16%%We certify the king that, if this city shall be built again, and its walls set up, by this means thou wilt have no portion on this side of the river.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%17%%Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and to the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%18%%The letter which ye sent to us hath been plainly read before me.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%19%%And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%20%%There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%21%%Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%22%%Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%23%%Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%4%%24%%Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%1%%Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%2%%Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%3%%At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus to them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%4%%Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%5%%But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%6%%The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side of the river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were on this side of the river, sent to Darius the king:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%7%%They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus; To Darius the king, all peace.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%8%%Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work proceedeth rapidly, and prospereth in their hands.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%9%%Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to erect these walls?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%10%%We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%11%%And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was erected these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and set up.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%12%%But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%13%%But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon, the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%14%%And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%15%%And said to him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in its place.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%16%%Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%5%%17%%Now therefore, if it seemeth good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure-house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%1%%Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%2%%And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and in it was a record thus written:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%3%%In the first year of Cyrus the king, the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be built, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations of it be strongly laid; the hight of it sixty cubits, and the breadth of it sixty cubits;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%4%%With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%5%%And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought to Babylon, be restored, and brought again to the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to its place, and place them in the house of God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%6%%Now therefore, Tatnai governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, who are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%7%%Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in its place.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%8%%Moreover, I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given to these men, that they be not hindered.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%9%%And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests who are at Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%10%%That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%11%%Also I have made a decree, that whoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%12%%And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall attempt to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%13%%Then Tatnai governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%14%%And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%15%%And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%16%%And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%17%%And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%18%%And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, who is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%19%%And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%20%%For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%21%%And the children of Israel, who had returned from captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%6%%22%%And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%1%%Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%2%%The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%3%%The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%4%%The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%5%%The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%6%%This Ezra went from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%7%%And there went some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%8%%And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%9%%For upon the first day of the first month he began to go from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%10%%For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%11%%Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%12%%Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%13%%I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, who are disposed of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with thee.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%14%%Forasmuch as thou art sent by the king, and by his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%15%%And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%16%%And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the free-will-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%17%%That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat-offerings and their drink-offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%18%%And whatever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do after the will of your God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%19%%The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%20%%And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%21%%And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%22%%To a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%23%%Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%24%%Also we certify you, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%25%%And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, set magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%26%%And whoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%27%%Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%7%%28%%And hath extended mercy to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I assembled out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%1%%These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%2%%Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%3%%Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%4%%Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%5%%Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%6%%Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%7%%And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%8%%And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%9%%Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%10%%And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%11%%And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%12%%And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%13%%And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%14%%Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%15%%And I assembled them at the river that runneth to Ahava; and there we abode in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%16%%Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%17%%And I sent them with commandment to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say to Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%18%%And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%19%%And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%20%%Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%21%%Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%22%%For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%23%%So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was entreated by us.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%24%%Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%25%%And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%26%%I even weighed to their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, and of gold a hundred talents;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%27%%Also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%28%%And I said to them, Ye are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a free-will-offering to the LORD God of your fathers.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%29%%Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them, before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%30%%So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%31%%Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%32%%And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%33%%Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%34%%By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%35%%Also the children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, offered burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burnt-offering to the LORD.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%8%%36%%And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side of the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%1%%Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%2%%For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%3%%And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%4%%Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat confounded until the evening sacrifice.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%5%%And at the evening sacrifice I arose from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%6%%And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%7%%Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass to this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%8%%And now for a little space grace hath been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%9%%For we were bond-men; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations of it, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%10%%And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%11%%Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%12%%Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%13%%And after all that hath come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%14%%Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%9%%15%%O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we having escaped, remain yet, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%1%%Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very bitterly.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%2%%And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken foreign wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%3%%Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%4%%Arise; for this matter belongeth to thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%5%%Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. And they swore.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%6%%Then Ezra arose from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he ate no bread, nor drank water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%7%%And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem;
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%8%%And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%9%%Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, and the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%10%%And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken foreign wives to increase the trespass of Israel.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%11%%Now therefore make confession to the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the foreign wives.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%12%%Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%13%%But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand abroad, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%14%%Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them who have taken foreign wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter shall be turned from us.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%15%%Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%16%%And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%17%%And they made an end with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%18%%And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%19%%And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%20%%And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%21%%And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%22%%And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%23%%Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%24%%Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%25%%Moreover, of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%26%%And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%27%%And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%28%%Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%29%%And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%30%%And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%31%%And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%32%%Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%33%%Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%34%%Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%35%%Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%43%%Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah.
1000005%%Ezra%%OT%%10%%44%%All these had taken foreign wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%1%%The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%2%%That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%3%%And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%4%%And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%5%%And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%6%%Let thy ear now be attentive, and thy eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%7%%We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%8%%Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%9%%But if ye turn to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you driven to the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%10%%Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%1%%11%%O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cup-bearer.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%1%%And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not before been sad in his presence.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%2%%Wherefore the king said to me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very greatly afraid,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%3%%And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lieth waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%4%%Then the king said to me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%5%%And I said to the king, If it should please the king, and if thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldst send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchers, that I may build it.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%6%%And the king said to me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%7%%Moreover, I said to the king, If it should please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%8%%And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%9%%Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%10%%When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%11%%So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%12%%And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%13%%And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon-well, and to the dung-port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and their gates were consumed with fire.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%14%%Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%15%%Then I went up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%16%%And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%17%%Then said I to them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and its gates are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we may be no more a reproach.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%18%%Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%19%%But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%2%%20%%Then I answered them, and said to them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%1%%Then Eliashib the high priest arose with his brethren the priests, and they built the sheep-gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even to the tower of Meah they sanctified it, to the tower of Hananeel.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%2%%And next to him built the men of Jericho. And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%3%%But the fish-gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid its beams, and set up its doors, its locks and its bars.

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%16%%After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Beth-zur, to the place over against the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty.

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%27%%After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great projecting tower, even to the wall of Ophel.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%28%%From above the horse-gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%31%%After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son, to the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%3%%32%%And between the ascent of the corner to the sheep-gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%1%%But it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%2%%And he spoke before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%3%%Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox should go up, he would even break down their stone wall.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%4%%Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%5%%And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%6%%So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half of it, for the people had a mind to work.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%7%%But it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were set up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%8%%And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%9%%Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%10%%And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%11%%And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%12%%And it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return to us they will be upon you.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%13%%Therefore I set in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%14%%And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be ye not afraid of them: remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%15%%And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%16%%And it came to pass, from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%17%%They who built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%18%%For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%19%%And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%20%%In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither to us: our God will fight for us.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%21%%So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%22%%Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor in the day.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%4%%23%%So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%1%%And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%2%%For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%3%%Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%4%%There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%5%%Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%6%%And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%7%%Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact interest, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%8%%And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, who were sold to the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and found nothing to answer.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%9%%Also I said, That is not good which ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%10%%I likewise, my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%11%%Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%12%%Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%13%%Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%14%%Moreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%15%%But the former governors, that had been before me were chargeable to the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their servants bore rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%16%%Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither to the work.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%17%%Moreover, there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came to us from among the heathen that were about us.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%18%%Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days an abundance of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%5%%19%%Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%1%%Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%2%%That Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%3%%And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%4%%Yet they sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%5%%Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%6%%In which was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%7%%And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%8%%Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thy own heart.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%9%%For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it may not be done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%10%%Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%11%%And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%12%%And lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%13%%Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%14%%My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%15%%So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%16%%And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought by our God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%17%%Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%18%%For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%6%%19%%Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%1%%Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%2%%That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%3%%And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%4%%Now the city was large and great: but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%5%%And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%6%%These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city;

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%68%%Their horses, seven hundred and thirty six: their mules, two hundred and forty five:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%69%%Their camels, four hundred and thirty five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%70%%And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%71%%And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%72%%And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty seven priests' garments.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%7%%73%%So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%1%%And all the people assembled as one man in the street that was before the water-gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%2%%And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%3%%And he read therein before the street that was before the water-gate from the morning until mid-day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%4%%And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%5%%And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%6%%And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%7%%Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%8%%So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%9%%And Nehemiah, who is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest, the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%10%%Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our Lord: neither be ye sad; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%11%%So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%12%%And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%13%%And on the second day were assembled the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, to Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%14%%And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%15%%And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%16%%So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water-gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%17%%And all the congregation of them that had returned from the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day, had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%8%%18%%Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the manner.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%1%%Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%2%%And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%3%%And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshiped the LORD their God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%4%%Then stood upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice to the LORD their God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%5%%Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%6%%Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are in it, the seas, and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%7%%Thou art the LORD the God, who chosest Abram, and broughtest him forth from Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%8%%And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%9%%And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%10%%And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%11%%And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%12%%Moreover, thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%13%%Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spokest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%14%%And madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%15%%And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%16%%But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%17%%And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst perform among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%18%%Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%19%%Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%20%%Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%21%%Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes grew not old, and their feet swelled not.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%22%%Moreover, thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%23%%Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%24%%So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%25%%And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards and olive-yards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they ate and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%26%%Nevertheless, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%27%%Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them deliverers, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%28%%But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned and cried to thee, thou hearedest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%29%%And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again to thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man doeth, he shall live in them:) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%30%%Yet many years didst thou forbear over them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore thou gavest them into the hand of the people of the lands.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%31%%Nevertheless, for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%32%%Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%33%%But thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%34%%Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%35%%For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%36%%Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%37%%And it yieldeth much increase to the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%9%%38%%And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, set their seals to it.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%10%%1%%Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%10%%29%%They united with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%10%%31%%And if the people of the land should bring wares or any provisions on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%10%%32%%Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%10%%34%%And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:

1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%8%%Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%9%%Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%10%%And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%11%%And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%12%%And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%13%%Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%14%%Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%15%%Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%16%%Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%17%%Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%18%%Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%19%%And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%20%%Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%21%%Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%22%%The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%23%%The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even till the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%24%%And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%25%%Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the threshholds of the gates.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%26%%These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%27%%And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%28%%And the sons of the singers assembled, both out of the plain country around Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%29%%Also from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had built them villages around Jerusalem.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%30%%And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%31%%Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, of which one went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%32%%And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%33%%And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%34%%Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%35%%And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%36%%And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%37%%And at the fountain-gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%38%%And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%39%%And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish-gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep-gate: and they stood still in the prison-gate.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%40%%So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%41%%And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%42%%And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%43%%Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%44%%And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%45%%And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%46%%For in the days of David, and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%12%%47%%And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%1%%On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%2%%Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Baalam against them, that he should curse them: but our God turned the curse into a blessing.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%3%%Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%4%%And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%5%%And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where formerly they laid the meat-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%6%%But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king, and after certain days I obtained leave of the king:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%7%%And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%8%%And it grieved me greatly: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%9%%Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither I brought again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat-offering and the frankincense.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%10%%And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled every one to his field.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%11%%Then I contended with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? and I assembled them, and set them in their place.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%12%%Then all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil to the treasuries.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%13%%And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were accounted faithful; and their office was to distribute to their brethren.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%14%%Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its offices.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%15%%In those days I saw in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day in which they sold provisions.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%16%%There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%17%%Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%18%%Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%19%%And it came to pass, that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%20%%So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%21%%Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%22%%And I commanded the Levites, that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%23%%In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%24%%And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews language, but according to the language of each people.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%25%%And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters to your sons, or for yourselves.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%26%%Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%27%%Shall we then hearken to you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying foreign wives?
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%28%%And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%29%%Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%30%%Thus I cleansed them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
1000005%%Nehemiah%%OT%%13%%31%%And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%1%%Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Cush, over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%2%%That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%3%%In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%4%%When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and eighty days.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%5%%And when these days had expired, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%6%%Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black marble.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%7%%And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%8%%And the drinking was according to the law; none constrained: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%9%%Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%10%%On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%11%%To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%12%%But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%13%%Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king's manner towards all that knew law and judgment:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%14%%And the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and who sat the first in the kingdom;)
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%15%%What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%16%%And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%17%%For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, so that they will despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%18%%Likewise will the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king's princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus will there arise too much contempt and wrath.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%19%%If it pleaseth the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%20%%And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%21%%And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%1%%22%%For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%1%%After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%2%%Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%3%%And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may collect all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%4%%And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%5%%Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%6%%Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%7%%And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%8%%So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were assembled at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%9%%And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens who were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids to the best place of the house of the women.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%10%%Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not show it.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%11%%And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%12%%Now when every maid's turn had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%13%%Then thus came every maiden to the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%14%%In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%15%%Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%16%%So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%17%%And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%18%%Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%19%%And when the virgins were assembled the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%20%%Esther had not yet showed her kindred, nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther performed the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%21%%In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%22%%And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king of it in Mordecai's name.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%2%%23%%And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%1%%After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%2%%And all the king's servants that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%3%%Then the king's servants who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king's commandment?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%4%%Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%5%%And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%6%%And he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shown him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%7%%In the first month, (that is, the month Nisan,) in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%8%%And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%9%%If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%10%%And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews enemy.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%11%%And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%12%%Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province, according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%13%%And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%14%%The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province, was published to all people, that they should be ready against that day.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%3%%15%%The posts departed, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%1%%When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%2%%And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%3%%And in every province whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%4%%So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%5%%Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%6%%So Hatach went forth to Mordecai, to the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%7%%And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%8%%Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%9%%And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%10%%Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%11%%All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%12%%And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%13%%Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%14%%For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, then will there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house will be destroyed: and who knoweth, whether thou hast come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%15%%Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%16%%Go, assemble all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%4%%17%%So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%1%%Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%2%%And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%3%%Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%4%%And Esther answered, If it shall seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%5%%Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%6%%And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%7%%Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%8%%If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to-morrow as the king hath said.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%9%%Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%10%%Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%11%%And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%12%%Haman said moreover, Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to-morrow I am invited to her also with the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%13%%Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%5%%14%%Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to-morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it: then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%1%%In that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%2%%And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%3%%And the king said, What honor and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered to him, There is nothing done for him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%4%%And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%5%%And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%6%%So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%7%%And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honor,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%8%%Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%9%%And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king delighteth to honor, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%10%%Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%11%%Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%12%%And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%13%%And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou wilt not prevail against him, but wilt surely fall before him.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%6%%14%%And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%1%%So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%2%%And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%3%%Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it shall please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%4%%For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bond-men and bond-women, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%5%%Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%6%%And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%7%%And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace-garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%8%%Then the king returned out of the palace-garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen upon the bed on which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%9%%And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%7%%10%%So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%1%%On that day the king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews' enemy, to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%2%%And the king took off his ring which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%3%%And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%4%%Then the king held out the golden scepter towards Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%5%%And said, If it shall please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing shall seem right before the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%6%%For how can I endure to see the evil that will come to my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%7%%Then the king Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%8%%Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleaseth you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, no man may reverse.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%9%%Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day of it; and it was written, according to all that Mordecai commanded, to the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India to Cush, a hundred twenty and seven provinces, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%10%%And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus's name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%11%%In which the king granted the Jews who were in every city to assemble, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%12%%Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%13%%The copy of the writing for a commandment, to be given in every province was published to all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%14%%So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%15%%And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced, and was glad:
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%16%%The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%8%%17%%And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%1%%Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%2%%The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%3%%And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%4%%For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai became greater and greater.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%5%%Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would to those that hated them.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%6%%And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%7%%And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%8%%And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%9%%And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%10%%The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, they slew; but on the spoil they laid not their hand.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%11%%On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%12%%And the king said to Esther the queen, the Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%13%%Then said Esther, If it shall please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%14%%And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%15%%For the Jews that were in Shushan assembled on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%16%%But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces assembled, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, (but they laid not their hands on the prey.)
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%17%%On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%18%%But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled on the thirteenth day of the month, and on the fourteenth of it: and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%19%%Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%20%%And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%21%%To establish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%22%%As the days in which the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%23%%And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%24%%Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%25%%But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%26%%Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come to them,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%27%%The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves to them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%28%%And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%29%%Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%30%%And he sent the letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%31%%To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%9%%32%%And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%10%%1%%And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%10%%2%%And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
1000005%%Esther%%OT%%10%%3%%For Mordecai the Jew was next to king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%1%%There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and shunned evil.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%2%%And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%3%%His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%4%%And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%5%%And it was so, when the days of their feasting were ended, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%6%%Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%7%%And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%8%%And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%9%%Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for naught?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%10%%Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%11%%But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%12%%And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%13%%And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%14%%And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%15%%And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%16%%While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God hath fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%17%%While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%18%%While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%19%%And behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%20%%Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%21%%And said, Naked came I from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: The LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%1%%22%%In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%1%%Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%2%%And the LORD said to Satan, Whence comest thou? and Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down upon it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%3%%And the LORD said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and shunneth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%4%%And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, even, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%5%%But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%6%%And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; but save his life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%7%%So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%8%%And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself with it; and he sat down among the ashes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%9%%Then said his wife to him, Dost thou still retain thy integrity? curse God, and die.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%10%%But he said to her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%11%%Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him, and to comfort him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%12%%And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they raised their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%2%%13%%So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%1%%After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%2%%And Job spoke, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%3%%Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a mail child conceived.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%4%%Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%5%%Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%6%%As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%7%%Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%8%%Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%9%%Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%10%%Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%11%%Why died I not from the womb? why did I not expire at the time of my birth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%12%%Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%13%%For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%14%%With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%15%%Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%16%%Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%17%%There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%18%%There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%19%%The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%20%%Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%21%%Who long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%22%%Who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%23%%Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%24%%For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%25%%For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%3%%26%%I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%1%%Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%2%%If we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%3%%Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%4%%Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%5%%But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%6%%Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%7%%Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%8%%Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%9%%By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%10%%The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%11%%The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%12%%Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%13%%In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%14%%Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%15%%Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%16%%It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%17%%Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%18%%Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%19%%How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%20%%They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%4%%21%%Doth not their excellence which is in them depart? they die, even without wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%1%%Call now, if there is any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%2%%For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%3%%I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%4%%His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%5%%Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%6%%Although affliction cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%7%%Yet man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%8%%I would seek to God, and to God would I commit my cause:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%9%%Who doeth great things and unsearchable; wonderful things without number:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%10%%Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%11%%To set on high those that are low: that those who mourn may be exalted to safety.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%12%%He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%13%%He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%14%%They meet with darkness in the day-time, and grope in the noon-day as in the night.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%15%%But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%16%%So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%17%%Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%18%%For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%19%%He will deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%20%%In famine he will redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%21%%Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%22%%At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%23%%For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%24%%And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle will be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%25%%Thou shalt know also that thy seed will be great, and thy offspring as the grass of the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%26%%Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%5%%27%%Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%1%%But Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%2%%Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%3%%For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%4%%For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%5%%Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%6%%Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%7%%The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%8%%Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%9%%Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%10%%Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%11%%What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%12%%Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%13%%Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%14%%To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%15%%My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%16%%Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and in which the snow is hid:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%17%%In the time when they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%18%%The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%19%%The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%20%%They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%21%%For now ye are nothing: ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%22%%Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%23%%Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%24%%Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%25%%How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%26%%Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%27%%Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%28%%Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident to you if I lie.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%29%%Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%6%%30%%Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%1%%Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a hireling?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%2%%As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%3%%So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%4%%When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%5%%My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%6%%My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%7%%O remember that my life is wind: my eye will no more see good.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%8%%The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thy eyes are upon me, and I am not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%9%%As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%10%%He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%11%%Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%12%%Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%13%%When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%14%%Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%15%%So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%16%%I lothe it; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%17%%What is man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%18%%And that thou shouldst visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%19%%How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%20%%I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%7%%21%%And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%1%%Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%2%%How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%3%%Doth God pervert judgment; or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%4%%If thy children have sinned against him, and he hath cast them away for their transgression;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%5%%If thou wouldst seek to God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%6%%If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%7%%Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end would greatly increase.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%8%%For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%9%%(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%10%%Will they not teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%11%%Can the rush grow without mire? can the flag grow without water?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%12%%Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%13%%So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%14%%Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%15%%He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%16%%He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%17%%His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%18%%If he shall destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%19%%Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%20%%Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%21%%Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%8%%22%%They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to naught.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%1%%Then Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%2%%I know it to be so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%3%%If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%4%%He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%5%%Who removeth the mountains, and they know not: who overturneth them in his anger.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%6%%Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%7%%Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%8%%Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%9%%Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%10%%Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%11%%Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%12%%Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%13%%If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%14%%How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%15%%Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%16%%If I had called, and he had answered me; yet I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%17%%For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%18%%He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%19%%If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%20%%If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, that also will prove me perverse.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%21%%Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%22%%This is one thing, therefore I said it, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%23%%If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%24%%The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, and who is he?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%25%%Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%26%%They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%27%%If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%28%%I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%29%%If I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%30%%If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%31%%Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%32%%For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%33%%Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%34%%Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%9%%35%%Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%1%%My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%2%%I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%3%%Is it good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%4%%Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%5%%Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%6%%That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%7%%Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thy hand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%8%%Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%9%%Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%10%%Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%11%%Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%12%%Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%13%%And these things hast thou hid in thy heart: I know that this is with thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%14%%If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%15%%If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%16%%For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%17%%Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%18%%Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%19%%I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%20%%Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%21%%Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%10%%22%%A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shades of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%1%%Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%2%%Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%3%%Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%4%%For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thy eyes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%5%%But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%6%%And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thy iniquity deserveth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%7%%Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%8%%It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%9%%The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%10%%If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%11%%For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%12%%For vain man would be wise, though man is born like a wild ass's colt.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%13%%If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%14%%If iniquity is in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%15%%For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%16%%Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%17%%And thy age shall be clearer than the noon-day: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%18%%And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%19%%Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%11%%20%%But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the expiration of the breath.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%1%%And Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%2%%No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%3%%But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yes, who knoweth not such things as these?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%4%%I am as one mocked by his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is derided.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%5%%He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%6%%The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%7%%But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%8%%Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare to thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%9%%Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%10%%In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%11%%Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste its food?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%12%%With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%13%%With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%14%%Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%15%%Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%16%%With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%17%%He leadeth counselors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%18%%He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%19%%He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%20%%He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%21%%He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%22%%He revealeth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth to light the shades of death.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%23%%He increaseth nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth nations, and straiteneth them again.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%24%%He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%12%%25%%They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%1%%Lo, my eye hath seen all this, my ear hath heard and understood it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%2%%What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior to you.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%3%%Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%4%%But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%5%%O that ye would altogether hold your peace and it would be your wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%6%%Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%7%%Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%8%%Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%9%%Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%10%%He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%11%%Shall not his excellence make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%12%%Your remembrances are like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%13%%Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%14%%Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%15%%Though he shall slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%16%%He also shall be my salvation: for a hypocrite shall not come before him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%17%%Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%18%%Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%19%%Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall expire.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%20%%Only do not two things to me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%21%%Withdraw thy hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%22%%Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%23%%How many are my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%24%%Why hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thy enemy?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%25%%Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%26%%For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%27%%Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly to all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%13%%28%%And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%1%%Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%2%%He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%3%%And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%4%%Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%5%%Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%6%%Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%7%%For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%8%%Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%9%%Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%10%%But man dieth, and wasteth away: yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where is he?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%11%%As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%12%%So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens shall be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%13%%O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%14%%If a man dieth, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%15%%Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%16%%For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%17%%My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%18%%And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%19%%The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%20%%Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%21%%His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%14%%22%%But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%1%%Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%2%%Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%3%%Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%4%%Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%5%%For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%6%%Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yes, thy own lips testify against thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%7%%Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%8%%Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%9%%What knowest thou that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%10%%With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%11%%Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%12%%Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%13%%That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%14%%What is man, that he should be clean? and he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%15%%Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%16%%How much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%17%%I will show thee, hear me; and that which I have seen, I will declare;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%18%%Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%19%%To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%20%%The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%21%%A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%22%%He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%23%%He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%24%%Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%25%%For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%26%%He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%27%%Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%28%%And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%29%%He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%30%%He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%31%%Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%32%%It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%33%%He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%34%%For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%15%%35%%They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%1%%Then Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%2%%I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%3%%Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%4%%I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%5%%But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%6%%Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%7%%But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%8%%And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%9%%He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%10%%They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%11%%God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%12%%I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%13%%His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%14%%He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%15%%I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%16%%My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids are the shades of death;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%17%%Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%18%%O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%19%%Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%20%%My friends scorn me: but my eye poureth out tears to God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%21%%O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%16%%22%%When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%1%%My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%2%%Are there not mockers with me? and doth not my eye continue in their provocation?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%3%%Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%4%%For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%5%%He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%6%%He hath made me also a by-word of the people; and in former time I was as a tabret.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%7%%My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shade.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%8%%Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%9%%The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%10%%But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%11%%My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%12%%They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%13%%If I wait, the grave is my house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%14%%I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%15%%And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who will see it?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%17%%16%%They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%1%%Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%2%%How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%3%%Why are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%4%%He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%5%%Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%6%%The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%7%%The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%8%%For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%9%%The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%10%%The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%11%%Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%12%%His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%13%%It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the first-born of death shall devour his strength.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%14%%His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%15%%It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%16%%His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%17%%His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%18%%He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%19%%He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%20%%They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%18%%21%%Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%1%%Then Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%2%%How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%3%%These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%4%%And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remaineth with myself.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%5%%If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%6%%Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath encompassed me with his net.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%7%%Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%8%%He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%9%%He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%10%%He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope hath he removed like a tree.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%11%%He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me to him as one of his enemies.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%12%%His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp around my tabernacle.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%13%%He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%14%%My kinsmen have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%15%%They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%16%%I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%17%%My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children's sake of my own body.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%18%%Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%19%%All my intimate friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%20%%My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%21%%Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%22%%Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%23%%Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%24%%That they were graven with an iron pen in lead, in the rock for ever!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%25%%For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he will stand at the latter day upon the earth:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%26%%And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%27%%Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%28%%But ye would say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%19%%29%%Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%1%%Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%2%%Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%3%%I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%4%%Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%5%%That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%6%%Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%7%%Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they who have seen him shall say, Where is he?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%8%%He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%9%%The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%10%%His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%11%%His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%12%%Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, though he may hide it under his tongue;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%13%%Though he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%14%%Yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%15%%He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%16%%He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%17%%He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%18%%That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%19%%Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%20%%Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%21%%There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%22%%In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%23%%When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%24%%He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%25%%It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%26%%All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%27%%The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%28%%The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%20%%29%%This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%1%%But Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%2%%Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%3%%Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%4%%As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%5%%Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%6%%Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%7%%Why do the wicked live, become old, and, are mighty in power?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%8%%Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%9%%Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%10%%Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%11%%They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%12%%They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%13%%They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%14%%Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%15%%What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%16%%Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%17%%How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and how oft cometh their destruction upon them? God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%18%%They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%19%%God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%20%%His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%21%%For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%22%%Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%23%%One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%24%%His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%25%%And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%26%%They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%27%%Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%28%%For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%29%%Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%30%%That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they will be brought forth to the day of wrath.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%31%%Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%32%%Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%33%%The clods of the valley will be sweet to him, and every man will draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%21%%34%%How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%1%%Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%2%%Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%3%%Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%4%%Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%5%%Is not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%6%%For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%7%%Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%8%%But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%9%%Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%10%%Therefore snares are around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%11%%Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%12%%Is not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%13%%And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%14%%Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%15%%Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%16%%Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%17%%Who said to God, depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%18%%Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%19%%The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent deride them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%20%%Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%21%%Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: by this good shall come to thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%22%%Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%23%%If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%24%%Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%25%%Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%26%%For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%27%%Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%28%%Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%29%%When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is exaltation; and he shall save the humble person.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%22%%30%%He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%1%%Then Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%2%%Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%3%%Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%4%%I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%5%%I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%6%%Would he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%7%%There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%8%%Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%9%%On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%10%%But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%11%%My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%12%%Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%13%%But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%14%%For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%15%%Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%16%%For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%23%%17%%Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%1%%Why, seeing times are not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%2%%Some remove the landmarks: they violently take away flocks, and their feed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%3%%They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%4%%They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%5%%Behold, as wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%6%%They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%7%%They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%8%%They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%9%%They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%10%%They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%11%%Who make oil within their walls, and tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%12%%Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%13%%They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%14%%The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%15%%The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%16%%In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the day-time: they know not the light.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%17%%For the morning is to them even as the shades of death: if one knoweth them, they are in the terrors of the shades of death.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%18%%He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%19%%Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters: so doth the grave those who have sinned.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%20%%The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%21%%He oppresseth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%22%%He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%23%%Though it is given him to be in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%24%%They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%24%%25%%And if it is not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%1%%Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%2%%Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%3%%Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%4%%How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%5%%Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; and the stars are not pure in his sight.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%25%%6%%How much less man, that is a worm; and the son of man, who is a worm?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%1%%But Job answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%2%%How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%3%%How hast thou counseled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou abundantly declared the thing as it is?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%4%%To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%5%%Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%6%%Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%7%%He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%8%%He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%9%%He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%10%%He hath encompassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%11%%The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%12%%He divideth the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%13%%By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%26%%14%%Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%1%%Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%2%%As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty who hath afflicted my soul;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%3%%All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%4%%My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%5%%Far be it from me that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%6%%My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%7%%Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%8%%For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%9%%Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%10%%Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%11%%I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%12%%Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%13%%This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%14%%If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%15%%Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%16%%Though he should heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%17%%He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%18%%He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%19%%The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%20%%Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%21%%The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%22%%For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%27%%23%%Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%1%%Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%2%%Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is melted out of the stone.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%3%%He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shades of death.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%4%%The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant: even the waters forgotten by the foot: they are dried up, they have gone away from men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%5%%As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%6%%The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%7%%There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vultur's eye hath not seen:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%8%%The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%9%%He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%10%%He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%11%%He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid he bringeth forth to light.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%12%%But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%13%%Man knoweth not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%14%%The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%15%%It cannot be obtained for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%16%%It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%17%%The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%18%%No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%19%%The topaz of Cush shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%20%%Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%21%%Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%22%%Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame of it with our ears.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%23%%God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth its place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%24%%For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%25%%To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%26%%When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%27%%Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%28%%28%%And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%1%%Moreover, Job continued his parable, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%2%%Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%3%%When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%4%%As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%5%%When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%6%%When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%7%%When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%8%%The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%9%%The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%10%%The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%11%%When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%12%%Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%13%%The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%14%%I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%15%%I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%16%%I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%17%%And I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%18%%Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%19%%My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%20%%My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%21%%To me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%22%%After my words they spoke not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%23%%And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%24%%If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%29%%25%%I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%1%%But now they that are younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%2%%Yes, to what might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age had perished?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%3%%For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%4%%Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%5%%They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a thief;)
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%6%%To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%7%%Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%8%%They were children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%9%%And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%10%%They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%11%%Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%12%%Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%13%%They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%14%%They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%15%%Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%16%%And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%17%%My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%18%%By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%19%%He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%20%%I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%21%%Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%22%%Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%23%%For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%24%%Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%25%%Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%26%%When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%27%%My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%28%%I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%29%%I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%30%%My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%30%%31%%My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%1%%I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%2%%For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%3%%Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%4%%Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%5%%If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%6%%Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%7%%If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%8%%Then let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%9%%If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbor's door;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%10%%Then let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%11%%For this is a hainous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%12%%For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%13%%If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%14%%What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%15%%Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%16%%If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%17%%Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%18%%(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%19%%If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%20%%If his loins have not blessed me, and if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%21%%If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%22%%Then let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%23%%For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%24%%If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%25%%If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%26%%If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%27%%And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%28%%This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%29%%If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%30%%Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%31%%If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%32%%The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveler.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%33%%If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%34%%Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%35%%Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%36%%Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%37%%I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%38%%If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%39%%If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%31%%40%%Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%1%%So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%2%%Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%3%%Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%4%%Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken because they were older than he.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%5%%When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%6%%And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my opinion.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%7%%I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%8%%But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%9%%Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%10%%Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will show my opinion.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%11%%Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%12%%Yes, I attended to you, and behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%13%%Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%14%%Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%15%%They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%16%%When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%17%%I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%18%%For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%19%%Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%20%%I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%21%%Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%32%%22%%For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing, my Maker would soon take me away.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%1%%Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%2%%Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%3%%My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%4%%The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%5%%If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%6%%Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%7%%Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%8%%Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%9%%I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%10%%Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%11%%He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%12%%Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%13%%Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%14%%For God speaketh once, yes twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%15%%In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%16%%Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%17%%That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%18%%He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%19%%He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%20%%So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%21%%His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%22%%Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%23%%If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%24%%Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%25%%His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he will return to the days of his youth:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%26%%He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%27%%He looketh upon men, and if any shall say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%28%%He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%29%%Lo, all these things God often worketh with man,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%30%%To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%31%%Mark well, O Job, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%32%%If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%33%%33%%If not, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%1%%Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%2%%Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear to me, ye that have knowledge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%3%%For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%4%%Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%5%%For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%6%%Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%7%%What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%8%%Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%9%%For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%10%%Therefore hearken to me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%11%%For the work of a man he shall render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%12%%Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%13%%Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%14%%If he should set his heart upon man, if he should gather to himself his spirit and his breath;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%15%%All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%16%%If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%17%%Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%18%%Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%19%%How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%20%%In a moment they shall die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%21%%For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%22%%There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%23%%For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%24%%He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%25%%Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%26%%He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%27%%Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%28%%So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%29%%When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%30%%That the hypocrite may not reign, lest the people should be ensnared.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%31%%Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%32%%That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%33%%Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou shalt refuse, or whether thou shalt choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%34%%Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%35%%Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%36%%My desire is that Job may be tried to the end, because of his answers for wicked men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%34%%37%%For he addeth rebellion to his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%1%%Elihu spoke moreover, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%2%%Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%3%%For thou saidst, What advantage will it be to thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%4%%I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%5%%Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%6%%If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions are multiplied, what doest thou to him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%7%%If thou art righteous, what givest thou to him? or what receiveth he from thy hand?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%8%%Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art: and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%9%%By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%10%%But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%11%%Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%12%%There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%13%%Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%14%%Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%15%%But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%35%%16%%Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%1%%Elihu also proceeded, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%2%%Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%3%%I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%4%%For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%5%%Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%6%%He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%7%%He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%8%%And if they are bound in fetters, and are held in cords of affliction;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%9%%Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%10%%He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%11%%If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%12%%But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%13%%But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%14%%They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%15%%He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%16%%Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table would be full of fatness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%17%%But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%18%%Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%19%%Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%20%%Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%21%%Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%22%%Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%23%%Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%24%%Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%25%%Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%26%%Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%27%%For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor of it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%28%%Which the clouds do drop and distill upon man abundantly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%29%%Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%30%%Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%31%%For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%32%%With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the intervening cloud.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%36%%33%%The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%1%%At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%2%%Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%3%%He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%4%%After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%5%%God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things he doeth, which we cannot comprehend.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%6%%For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%7%%He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%8%%Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%9%%From the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold from the north.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%10%%By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%11%%Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%12%%And it is turned around by his counsels: that they may do whatever he commandeth them upon the face of the world on the earth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%13%%He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%14%%Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%15%%Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%16%%Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%17%%How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%18%%Hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong, and as a molten looking-glass?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%19%%Teach us what we shall say to him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%20%%Shall it be told him that I speak? If a man shall speak, surely he will be swallowed up.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%21%%And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%22%%Fair weather cometh from the north: with God is terrible majesty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%23%%Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice: he will not afflict.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%37%%24%%Men therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%1%%Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%2%%Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%3%%Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%4%%Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%5%%Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%6%%Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%7%%When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%8%%Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%9%%When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%10%%And broke up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%11%%And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%12%%Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the day-spring to know its place;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%13%%That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%14%%It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%15%%And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%16%%Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%17%%Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%18%%Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%19%%Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is its place,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%20%%That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%21%%Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%22%%Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%23%%Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%24%%By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%25%%Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%26%%To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness in which there is no man;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%27%%To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%28%%Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%29%%Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%30%%The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%31%%Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%32%%Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with its sons?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%33%%Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set its dominion on the earth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%34%%Canst thou lift thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%35%%Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say to thee, Here we are?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%36%%Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%37%%Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%38%%38%%When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%1%%Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%2%%When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%3%%Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for want of food.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%4%%Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%5%%Canst thou number the months that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%6%%They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%7%%Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not to them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%8%%Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%9%%Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%10%%He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%11%%The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%12%%Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%13%%Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%14%%Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labor to him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%15%%Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%16%%Gavest thou the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich!
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%17%%Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%18%%And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%19%%She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labor is in vain without fear;
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%20%%Because God hath withheld wisdom from her, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%21%%When she lifteth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%22%%Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%23%%Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%24%%He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%25%%He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%26%%The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%27%%He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%28%%He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%29%%Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings towards the south?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%30%%Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%31%%She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%32%%From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%33%%Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%34%%Moreover, the LORD answered Job, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%35%%Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%36%%Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%37%%Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%39%%38%%Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%1%%Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%2%%Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%3%%Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%4%%Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%5%%Deck thyself now with majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%6%%Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%7%%Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%8%%Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%9%%Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%10%%Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%11%%Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%12%%He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%13%%His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%14%%He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%15%%Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%16%%He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%17%%The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%18%%Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%19%%He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%20%%Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%21%%Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%22%%Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft words to thee?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%23%%Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%24%%Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%25%%Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%26%%Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%27%%Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%40%%28%%Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%1%%None is so fierce that he dare rouse him: who then is able to stand before me?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%2%%Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay him? whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%3%%I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%4%%Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%5%%Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible around.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%6%%His scales are his pride, shut together as with a close seal.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%7%%One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%8%%They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%9%%His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%10%%Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire dart forth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%11%%Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%12%%His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%13%%In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%14%%The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%15%%His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%16%%When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%17%%The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%18%%He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%19%%The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%20%%Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%21%%Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%22%%He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%23%%He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%24%%Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%41%%25%%He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%1%%Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%2%%I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%3%%Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that which I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%4%%Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will ask of thee, and declare thou to me.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%5%%I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye seeth thee.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%6%%Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%7%%And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%8%%Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%9%%So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%10%%And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%11%%Then came there to him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they condoled with him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ear-ring of gold.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%12%%So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%13%%He had also seven sons, and three daughters.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%14%%And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%15%%And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%16%%After this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
1000005%%Job%%OT%%42%%17%%So Job died, being old and full of days.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%1%%Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%2%%But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%3%%And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in season; its leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he doeth shall prosper.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%4%%The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%5%%Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%1%%6%%For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%1%%Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%2%%The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%3%%Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%4%%He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%5%%Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and trouble them in his sore displeasure.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%6%%Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%7%%I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said to me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%8%%Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%9%%Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%10%%Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%11%%Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%2%%12%%Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%2%%A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%3%%Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%4%%But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%5%%I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%6%%I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%7%%I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%8%%Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%3%%9%%Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%2%%To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%3%%O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%4%%But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%5%%Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%6%%Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%7%%There are many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%8%%Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time when their corn and their wine increased.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%4%%9%%I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%2%%To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%3%%Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to thee will I pray.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%4%%My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%5%%For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%6%%The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%7%%Thou shalt destroy them that speak falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%8%%But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy temple.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%9%%Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%10%%For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%11%%Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%12%%But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%5%%13%%For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%2%%To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%3%%Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%4%%My soul is also greatly disquieted: but thou, O LORD, how long?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%5%%Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%6%%For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%7%%I am weary with my groaning; all the night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%8%%My eye is consumed because of grief; it groweth old because of all my enemies.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%9%%Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%10%%The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%6%%11%%Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted: let them return and be suddenly ashamed.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%2%%Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjaminite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%3%%Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%4%%O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there is iniquity in my hands;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%5%%If I have rewarded evil to him that was at peace with me; (yes, I have delivered him that without cause is my enemy:)
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%6%%Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yes, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay my honor in the dust. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%7%%Arise, O LORD, in thy anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of my enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%8%%So shall the congregation of the people encompass thee: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%9%%The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to my integrity that is in me.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%10%%Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%11%%My defense is from God, who saveth the upright in heart.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%12%%God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%13%%If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%14%%He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%15%%Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%16%%He made a pit, and digged it, and hath fallen into the ditch which he made.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%17%%His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%7%%18%%I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%2%%To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David. O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%3%%Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thy enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%4%%When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%5%%What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%6%%For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%7%%Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%8%%All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%8%%9%%The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passeth through the paths of the seas.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%4%%When my enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%5%%For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou sattest on the throne judging right.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%6%%Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%7%%O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial hath perished with them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%8%%But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%9%%And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%10%%The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%11%%And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%12%%Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%13%%When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%14%%Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer from them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%15%%That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%9%%16%%The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%1%%Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%2%%The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%3%%For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%4%%The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%5%%His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%6%%He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%7%%His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%8%%He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%9%%He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%10%%He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%11%%He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%12%%Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thy hand: forget not the humble.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%13%%Why doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%14%%Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself to thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%15%%Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou shalt find none.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%16%%The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen have perished out of his land.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%10%%17%%LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thy ear to hear:

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%1%%To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. In the LORD I put my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%2%%For lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%3%%If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%4%%The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%5%%The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%6%%Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and a horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%11%%7%%For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance beholdeth the upright.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%2%%To the chief Musician upon Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%3%%They speak vanity every one with his neighbor: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%4%%The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%5%%Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%6%%For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%7%%The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%8%%Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%12%%9%%The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%1%%To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%2%%How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%3%%Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%4%%Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%5%%But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%13%%6%%I will sing to the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%14%%1%%To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%14%%2%%The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%14%%3%%They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%14%%4%%Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%51%%19%%The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%51%%20%%Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%52%%10%%But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%52%%11%%I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%53%%2%%To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%53%%6%%There they were in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%9%%I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%10%%Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%11%%Day and night they go about it upon its walls: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%12%%Wickedness is in the midst of it: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%13%%For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that magnified himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%14%%But it was thou, a man my equal, my guide, and my acquaintance.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%55%%20%%God will hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%7%%In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%8%%He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%9%%They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%10%%The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%11%%Yes, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%12%%For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%13%%He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%14%%He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall be their blood in his sight.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%15%%And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%16%%There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%17%%His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%18%%Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%19%%And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and amen.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%72%%20%%The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%1%%A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%2%%But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%3%%For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%4%%For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%5%%They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they afflicted like other men.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%6%%Therefore pride encompasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%7%%Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%8%%They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%9%%They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%10%%Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%11%%And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%12%%Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%13%%Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%14%%For all the day long have I been afflicted, and chastened every morning.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%15%%If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%16%%When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%17%%Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood their end.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%18%%Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou didst cast them down into destruction.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%19%%How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%20%%As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%21%%Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%22%%So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%23%%Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast held me by my right hand.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%24%%Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%25%%Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%26%%My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%27%%For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go astray from thee.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%73%%28%%But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%1%%Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thy anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%2%%Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old: the rod of thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%3%%Lift up thy feet to the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%4%%Thy enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%5%%A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%6%%But now they break down the carved work of it at once with axes and hammers.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%7%%They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling-place of thy name to the ground.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%8%%They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%9%%We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%10%%O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%11%%Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%12%%For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%13%%Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%14%%Thou didst break the head of leviathan in pieces, and didst give him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%15%%Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou didst dry up mighty rivers.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%16%%The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%17%%Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%18%%Remember this, the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%19%%O deliver not the soul of thy turtle dove to the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%20%%Have respect to the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%21%%O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%22%%Arise, O God, plead thy own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%74%%23%%Forget not the voice of thy enemies: the tumult of those that rise against thee increaseth continually.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%2%%To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. To thee, O God, do we give thanks, to thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%3%%When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%4%%The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%5%%I said to the fools, Deal not foolishly; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%6%%Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%7%%For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%8%%But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%9%%For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs of it all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%10%%But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%75%%11%%All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%2%%To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm or Song of Asaph. In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%3%%In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%4%%There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%5%%Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%6%%The stout-hearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%7%%At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%8%%Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%9%%Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%10%%When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%11%%Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath wilt thou restrain.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%12%%Vow, and pay to the LORD your God: let all that are about him bring presents to him that ought to be feared.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%76%%13%%He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%2%%To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph. I cried to God with my voice, even to God with my voice; and he gave ear to me.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%3%%In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%4%%I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%5%%Thou holdest my eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%6%%I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%7%%I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%8%%Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favorable no more?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%9%%Is his mercy wholly gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%10%%Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%11%%And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%12%%I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%13%%I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%14%%Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God!
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%15%%Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%16%%Thou hast with thy arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%17%%The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were disturbed.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%18%%The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thy arrows also went abroad.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%19%%The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%20%%Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%77%%21%%Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%1%%Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%2%%I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%3%%Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%4%%We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%5%%For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%6%%That the generation to come might know them, even the children who should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%7%%That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%8%%And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%9%%The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%10%%They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%11%%And forgot his works, and his wonders that he had shown them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%12%%Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%13%%He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%14%%In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%15%%He cleaved the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%16%%He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%17%%And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%18%%And they tempted God in their heart by asking food for their desire.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%19%%Yes, they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%20%%Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%21%%Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%22%%Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%23%%Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%24%%And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%25%%Man ate angels' food: he sent them food to the full.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%26%%He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%27%%He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%28%%And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%29%%So they ate, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%30%%They were not estranged from their desire: but while their meat was yet in their mouths,
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%31%%The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%32%%For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%33%%Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%34%%When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%35%%And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%36%%Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%37%%For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%38%%But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time he turned his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%39%%For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%40%%How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%41%%Yes, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%42%%They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%43%%How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%44%%And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%45%%He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%46%%He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%47%%He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with frost.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%48%%He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%49%%He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%50%%He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%51%%And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%52%%But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%53%%And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%54%%And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%55%%He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%56%%Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%57%%But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%58%%For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%59%%When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%60%%So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%61%%And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%62%%He gave over his people also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%63%%The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%64%%Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%65%%Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%66%%And he smote his enemies in the hinder part: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%67%%Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%68%%But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%69%%And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%70%%He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheep-folds:
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%71%%From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%78%%72%%So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%1%%A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen have come into thy inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%2%%The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food to the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints, to the beasts of the earth.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%3%%Their blood have they shed like water around Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%4%%We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that are around us.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%5%%How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%6%%Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%7%%For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling-place.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%8%%O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily succor us: for we are brought very low.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%9%%Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%10%%Why should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by avenging the blood of thy servants which is shed.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%11%%Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%12%%And render to our neighbors seven-fold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord.
1000005%%Psalms%%OT%%79%%13%%So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to all generations.
